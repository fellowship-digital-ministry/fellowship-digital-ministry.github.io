    <h1>God's Plan of Salvation</h1>
    
    <div class="scripture-verse large">
      <p>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
      <span class="reference">John 3:16 (KJV)</span>
    </div>
    
    <div class="salvation-steps">
      <div class="salvation-step">
        <h2>1. Recognize Your Need</h2>
        <p class="verse-reference">Romans 3:23</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."</p>
        <p>The Bible teaches that every person has sinned and fallen short of God's perfect standard. Sin separates us from a holy God and creates a spiritual need in our lives that we cannot fulfill on our own.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="salvation-step">
        <h2>2. Understand the Penalty</h2>
        <p class="verse-reference">Romans 6:23a</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"For the wages of sin is death..."</p>
        <p>Sin has consequences. The penalty for our sin is spiritual death and eternal separation from God. We cannot save ourselves through good works, religious rituals, or moral living.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="salvation-step">
        <h2>3. Believe the Good News</h2>
        <p class="verse-reference">Romans 5:8</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."</p>
        <p>God loves you so much that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for your sin. Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose again on the third day to provide the way of salvation.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="salvation-step">
        <h2>4. Receive God's Gift</h2>
        <p class="verse-reference">Romans 6:23b, Ephesians 2:8-9</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</p>
        <p>Salvation is a free gift from God. It cannot be earned through good works or religious activities. It comes only by placing your faith in Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="salvation-step">
        <h2>5. Call Upon the Lord</h2>
        <p class="verse-reference">Romans 10:9-10, 13</p>
        <p class="verse-text">"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation... For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</p>
        <p>You can receive Christ right now by faith through prayer. Prayer is talking with God. God knows your heart and is not as concerned with your words as He is with the attitude of your heart.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="salvation-prayer">
      <h2>How to Receive Christ</h2>
      <p>You can receive Jesus Christ as your Savior through a simple prayer of faith. Here is a suggested prayer:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. In Your Name, Amen."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you prayed this prayer with sincere faith, the Bible says you are now saved. Your decision to trust Christ is the most important decision you will ever make.</p>
    </div>
