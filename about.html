      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The Fellowship Baptist Church Sermon Library exists to provide a searchable collection of Biblical preaching that glorifies God, edifies believers, and reaches the lost with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
      
      <p>We believe that God's Word is living and powerful (Hebrews 4:12), and that faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17). Our mission is to make sound Biblical preaching accessible to as many people as possible through modern technology.</p>
