It says, now, no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous. How many of you can say amen? I agree, right? It's not enjoyable when you're dealing with the chastisement, but He's helping us by showing us what it proves and what it produces. He's helping us to understand that we're not going to faint, that we will despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, that we will endure chastening because we understand what it proves and what it produces. And yes, it's not joyous. It's not an enjoyable time. It's grievous as it says here in verse number 11. Notice what it says though.

And yes, it's not joyous. It's not an enjoyable time. It's grievous as it says here in verse number 11. Notice what it says though.
