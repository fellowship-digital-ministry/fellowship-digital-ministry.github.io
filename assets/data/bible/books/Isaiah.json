In Isaiah 9 in verse number 6, notice the Bible says, for unto us a child is born. But then notice it says this, unto us a son is given. A child is born, a son is given. God sent forth His Son. We see that in Galatians 4 and verse number 4, that what did God do? He sent forth His Son. When the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son. And it says here in Isaiah 9 in verse number 6, for unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.
