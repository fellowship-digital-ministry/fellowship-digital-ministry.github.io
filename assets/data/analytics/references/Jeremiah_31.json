      "text": "says, listen, such were some of you. Listen, we sang this morning, and Dean picks the songs. I don't pick the songs. You know what we sang this morning? I'm only a sinner saved by grace. Saved, saved. Those are the two songs we sang this morning. Praise the Lord. I'm only a sinner. But such were some of you. Listen, it's the grace of God. It's the grace of God, because the gospel converts. The law condemns, but the gospel converts. We find we don't have time to look at Jeremiah 31, jot it down perhaps, verses 27 through 34, and you find about the new covenant that is mentioned, but I wanna look at Romans 8 just for a moment. We mentioned Romans chapter number 7, and we looked at that passage dealing with the law condemning, but I want you to see Romans chapter number 8, because the gospel converts. When we look at Romans chapter number 8, in these first few verses of Romans chapter number 8, God gives to us this beautiful truth with regard to this new position that we have in Christ. Notice, if you've been saved by the grace of God this morning, you know for sure that heaven's your home. It's not of your works. There's nothing that you could do, but you went to that humbly to the Lord Jesus Christ and accept him as your personal savior. Notice what the Bible says in verse number 8,",
