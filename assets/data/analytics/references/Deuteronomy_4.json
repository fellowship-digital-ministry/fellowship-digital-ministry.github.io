      "text": "God gave the very words. It's important for us to understand that this morning, because again, before we are going to talk about what the Bible says, we must understand what the Bible is. And as we consider the truth of inspiration this morning, we see that inspiration reveals to us the greatness of God. Consider with me a truth from the book of Deuteronomy in chapter 4. And you don't need to turn there. I'll read the verse for you. You can if you want. But Deuteronomy chapter 4, of course God is preparing His people for entrance into the land of promise, and He's using Moses. And Moses is given this final charge, and it says in verse number 1 of Deuteronomy 4, Now therefore hearken, O Israel, under the statutes and under the judgments which I teach you, for to do them that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord God of your fathers giveth you. Notice what He says, Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. God's concerned about the very word. A jot and a tittle is what the Bible speaks about, that heaven and earth shall pass, but not a jot nor a tittle from God's Word is going",
