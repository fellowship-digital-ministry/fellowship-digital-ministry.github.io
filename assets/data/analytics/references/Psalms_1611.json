      "text": "in verse number 5, trust also in Him. You know, it's important that we trust Him. The Bible says, trust in the Lord with all thine heart. Not part of it, not most of it, but with all of it. We find that we sing the song, trust and obey, and there's no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey. Trusting Jesus, simply trusting. I'm so glad I learned to trust Him, the songwriter said. And indeed, our God is trustworthy. And He says to His people that we're to trust in the Lord. Notice verse number 4, the instruction, the nugget of truth given to us, delight thyself also in the Lord. On the front of our bulletins for today, if you looked at it, is Psalm 1611. And thy presence is fullness of joy. And what a blessing to enter into the presence of God, to understand the joy that God gives as we enter into His presence. But we delight thyself also in the Lord. And as we delight ourselves in the Lord, notice it says, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. I believe this morning as we look at this truth, and we actually see it in Psalm 21 and verse number 2, thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholding the request of his lips. I believe that as we delight ourselves in the Lord, that our desires are really God's desires.",
