It doesn't matter of the scheme and plan of the evil one and the wicked one to try to rid our society of this book. God said that his Word was settled and that his Word would not pass away. He said that he would preserve it from this generation forever. And we can rejoice this evening that we have a Bible. Not only did he promise to preserve his Word, but I want you to consider that he promised to us the power of his Word. He promised that his Word was powerful and it works. And now that encourages me because as a preacher, I've been instructed to preach the Word. And when we consider the place that the Bible has in our lives as individuals, we find that God has told us, listen, my Word is powerful. My Word will accomplish what I desire for it to accomplish. We're mindful of that very truth in Isaiah 55 and verse number 11, where here the promise is given with regard to the Word of God accomplishing its purpose. Notice in Isaiah 55 and verse number 11, the Bible says this, so shall my Word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please",

It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. Aren't you thankful for that promise? I mean, what a joy to understand. Listen, when we give the Word of God, we may not see the effects, we may not see the results immediately, but we can rest assured in what God has told us about his Word and the purpose of his Word, the power of his Word, and we can rest that it will accomplish what it's intended to accomplish. Notice in 1 Thessalonians chapter number two, as Paul is commending this church in Thessalonica and he's speaking to them about the ways in which they were growing and prospering in their faith and their love, and we find that he mentions to them specifically in 1 Thessalonians two, in verse number 13, the way in which God's Word had worked in their lives. And it encourages us for understanding this evening how God's Word continues to work in our lives. Notice in verse 13 of 1 Thessalonians two, the Bible says for this cause also, thank we God without. sing, because when you receive the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it",
