And then God equipped and enabled him to deliver those challenging messages to the two and a half tribes and to the leaders and the people of Israel before he would die. God enabled him. God equipped him. And God equips and enables each of us. Turn to the book of 1 Corinthians, if you will. And I want to go through a few verses here in the book of 1 Corinthians. And it's interesting as we look at this particular book, the church in Corinth, as we understand, turn to chapter number one to begin. But the church of Corinth is not a model church. The church in Corinth has lots of problems. The church in Corinth is being corrected for a lot of things that they're doing wrong. And the Lord would use the apostle Paul to pen this book in order to give them instruction with regard to how they were to serve the Lord and what was to take place. But when we understand and we're rejoicing for the ability to serve the Lord, I want you to see what God says to the people at Corinth with regard to their service. In verse number four of 1 Corinthians 1, notice what Paul says to these believers under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God. He says, I thank my God always on your behalf. Notice this, for the grace",

Notice this, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. I would submit to you this morning that that grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ is not only saving grace, though it encompasses that, but it's also serving grace and the ability to serve the Lord. Paul talks about the grace that was bestowed upon him. At the end of this book, we find that Peter mentions about being a good steward of the manifold grace of God. And we find here that he's speaking about, notice, the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ. That in everything, verse number five, ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you. Notice verse seven, so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, as you study the book of 1 Corinthians, you find that one of the reasons that there's some division and some jealousy and envy within the members of the church at Corinth is because of the subject of spiritual gifts. Some were saying, well, I have this gift and you",
