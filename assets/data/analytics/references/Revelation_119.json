      "text": "And so we begin looking in chapter number two, and it's the entirety of chapters two and three that give us these seven letters that are written to the churches in Asia. Now understand this is Asia Minor, is the region of the world in which these churches were located. And we find that today, if you were to look at a map, that would be modern day Turkey. And that is the location of which these seven churches were located. And we find that this is the second part of the book. We remember we mentioned in verse 19 of chapter one, the Bible says write the things which thou hast seen, and that was section one, chapter one, and the things which are, which is chapters two and three. And then the following, the end of the verse says, and the things which shall be hereafter. That begins the third section. The outline for the book is provided to us. It's there in Revelation 119. And that third and final section of the book of Revelation begins in chapter four, and goes all the way through chapter 22. And so we find that we're beginning that second point, if you will, of the outline that God has provided to us in his word. And the Bible says in verse number one of Revelation two, unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write, these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand,",
