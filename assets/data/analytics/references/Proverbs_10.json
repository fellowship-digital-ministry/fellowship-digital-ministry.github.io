      "text": "And we think about the imagery that is provided to us in verse 21, and no doubt when still even today, there are some that would have understood during the time of the Lord Jesus Christ that they would actually put scripture verses on their being, on their person, and yet they would not even understand because Jesus would point to them and say, understand us now, go find out what this means. We find this evening that there's great imagery here, but the reality is that we must know and receive that instruction. Forsake not the instruction. It's a great way to honor thy mother. Think of this in the book of Proverbs, again, a number of verses of scripture, but the second thought, a principle to obey with regard to practical tips on how to honor our mothers would be to walk in wisdom. The book of Proverbs is a book of wisdom. In Proverbs 10, I want you to look at a number of verses here, three different verses we'll look at with regard to this truth of walking in wisdom. The Bible says this in Proverbs 10 and verse number 1, the Proverbs of Solomon. Notice a wise son maketh a glad father, but then notice what the Bible says, a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother. We know we honor our mother by walking in wisdom. It's a heaviness, the Bible says, a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.",
