      "text": "he reminds them once again of the truth that Jesus is coming again. In fact, as you read through 1 Thessalonians, you see every chapter, 2 Thessalonians, the same thing, in every chapter there's a reference to the return of Christ, and it's a theme of both of these books. There was some false teaching that was affecting them as it's dealt with in the second book with regard to the day of the Lord, and it's set forth and straightened out because there were some that were led astray. They were given a counterfeit letter as if it came from Paul, and Paul instructs and corrects. You look at 2 Thessalonians 2 and you see specifically that being dealt with. But when we understand unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the imminent return of Christ, and we understand that John says, in the book of 1 John, that we would not be ashamed of him at his appearing. Then as you enter into the next portion of that scripture, that's at the end of chapter 2 of the book of 1 John, you get into chapter number 3, behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God. But then it talks about the truth there with regard to the coming of the Lord, and it says this in chapter number 3, in verse number 3, talking about verse 2, when he shall appear,",
