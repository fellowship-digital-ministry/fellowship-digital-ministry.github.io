      "text": "him. Saul made it his number one agenda. Most important thing, kill David. God spared him. We can read on a number of occasions how David was miraculously spared by God and how David testified even while he's on the run that there's but a step between me and death. But yet God preserved his life and God did bring him to the place of being king. And I want you to see what David says near the end of his life in 2 Samuel 22 and verse number 31, as for God, his way is perfect. His way is perfect. You say, well, what about that his way is perfect? I didn't see this coming. I didn't plan for this. That's not what I... His way is perfect. Why? Because he has a purpose. He has a plan. And his way is perfect. And we find that in his plan and in his purpose and understanding this morning that his way is perfect, we understand that he has a purpose ultimately, primarily, his purpose is to bring honor and glory to himself. Ultimately that's the purpose, the plan. How is he going to do that? A variety of ways. But we find this morning that as we look at David and he gives this testimony, his way is perfect. Notice the word of the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to all them that trust in him, a shield.",

      "text": "of the earth that wants a difficulty, honestly. I like it when things go easy, Brother Armando. I really do. But sometimes in the midst of those hardships, God's proving Himself and God's developing His children and God's allowing for His glory to be known to those that are watching. If thy strength fail in the day of adversity, if thy faith fail in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. See this morning, we understand that His way is perfect. You can see in Psalm 18, it's the similar passage that we see in 2 Samuel 22, but not only is His way perfect, but He always does right. We cannot say of ourselves that we always do the right thing. In fact, there are many times that we mess things up. Many of our difficulties are the result of our own doing. We just mess things up. But the Bible tells us that God always does what's right. Notice in Genesis 18 and verse 25, in Genesis 18 and verse 25, the Bible tells us in this text of Scripture a great truth. Notice what the Bible says in Genesis 18 and verse 25, that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee. But then notice at the end of the verse, shall not the judge of all the earth do right?",
