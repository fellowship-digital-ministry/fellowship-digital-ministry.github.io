In fact, as you read certain portions of the Scripture, I believe that the book of Romans is very much this way, and here we find in this section of the book of Hebrews that there's so much evidence that is given in presenting the case that Christ is superior, and we find that yes, He could have just said Christ is superior, but all of the supporting evidence that is being given to us throughout the Word of God that helps us to rightfully conclude that which is being presented to us and the truth that is being revealed. We understand that as we mentioned the superiority of the priesthood of Jesus Christ, that He's from a better order. We understand that He's after the order of Melchizedek and obvious fulfillment of Psalm 110 and verse number 4, that messianic prophecy, and it's properly applied to the person of Jesus Christ, God in flesh, and what a blessing that is for us to be able to see that. And we mentioned that not only would the book of Hebrews present Jesus as being that priest after the order of Melchizedek, but we find that the passages of Scripture that are before",

      "text": "tell us, and of them was the whole earth overspread? He wants us to understand the way in which the earth was replenished. He wants us to understand that all mankind was killed during the flood, and all men and every living being, they were all killed, they were destroyed. He told us specifically who got on the ark. He told us specifically who got off the ark. Why did He tell us about this event? Why did He tell us about the prophecy? Begin to see the way in which God is unfolding the future events that would happen and how we can look here and see this and begin to interpret properly future events that take place. And it's so important that we understand that. I mean, think about it this morning when we mentioned about the order of Melchizedek. I was chatting with someone after the service. The reality is that the truth of coming to that messianic psalm in Psalm 110 and thinking about this promise of this one that would come, Messiah, and as the prophecy would be given there, and they would be very familiar with it as they would understand here in Psalm 110 in verse number 4, where the Bible tells us, the Lord hath sworn and will not repent. Notice that terminology. The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, and then it says, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.",

The Lord hath sworn and will not repent, and then it says, thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. And then they think about Melchizedek, Melchizedek, where do we know that name from? I'm not sure that they would say that, but maybe for us. And they go back to Genesis 14 and they just look at a couple of verses of Scripture and they just, man, how does this all come to pass? We see now living in this day and living and looking back historically, we see how, and Holly and I were talking this afternoon, like the peel of the onion kind of coming off, the wrapping of the present coming off in the presentation. We find this such is the case with this prophecy of Noah recorded in these few verses of Scripture. It helps us to have a proper understanding of all that takes place. You know, there are a lot of people that take the approach that Ham was cursed. It doesn't say that Ham was cursed. It says cursed be Canaan. Amen? They try to make application to certain ethnicities with regard to that curse that is mentioned in Genesis chapter number nine. They were Canaanites that dwell in the land of Canaan, okay? They were servants of servants.",
