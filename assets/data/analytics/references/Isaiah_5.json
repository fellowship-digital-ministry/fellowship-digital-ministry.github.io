The Bible, you know, people talk about wanting to be politically correct. The reality is that I'd rather be biblically correct. Amen? And here the Bible says that the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget God. Isaiah chapter number 5. Notice what the Bible says here as we think about this truth that sin brings reproach. In Isaiah chapter number 5 and verses 20 and 21, the prophet of God is making us aware of the circumstances and the things that are going on in the time in which he's ministering. And the Bible says this in Isaiah 5 and verse 20, woe unto them that call evil good and good evil, that put darkness for light and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight. Woe unto them. the Bible says, that call evil good and good evil. Listen, the reality is I understand that Isaiah is prophesying at the time in which he's prophesying, and I understand the content of his prophecies in his ministry, but the reality this evening is that truth from the Bible is applicable to nations in general and to people groups.",
