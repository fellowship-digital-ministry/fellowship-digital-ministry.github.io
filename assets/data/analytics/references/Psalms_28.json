      "text": "being dealt with there in Titus 2 in verse 1. And we dealt with bibliology and on Wednesday evening, we started the section dealing with theology and understanding who God is. When you understand who He is, it really changes your life. And we find that because the psalmist understood the Lord is my rock, and he goes through and lists all of the things that God is to him, notice the response. Notice the result of understanding who God is. I will call upon the Lord. You're going to call upon Him because you understand who He is. You're going to call upon Him because you understand what He can do. And we find the psalmist says, who is worthy to be praised, so shall I be saved from my enemies. Look down and look at v. 30. The Bible says this, ask for God, His way is perfect. Very similar to what we just read in 2 Samuel 22 and v. 31. The Word of the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to all those that trust in Him. Psalm 28 and v. 7. The Lord is my strength and my shield. My heart trusted in Him and I am helped. Therefore, my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise Him. Psalm 33 and v. 20. Our soul waiteth for the Lord. He is our help and our shield. I'm so thankful. There are many other references that we could look at this evening.",
