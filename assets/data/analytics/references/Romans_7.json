      "text": "I am so thankful for sin shall not have dominion over you. Listen, you can be victorious. Actually, we're going to get to that in just a moment. We don't have to have that mentality of just, well, it's just what I am. It's just how I... No, no, no. Sin no longer has dominion over us. And I'm so thankful for that. Victory through Christ. Number seven, if you're taking notes, victory through Christ. We mentioned this morning, we spoke about the person, who He is, and we spoke about the fact that He is victorious. I'm thankful that His victory enables me to have victory. We're here in Romans 6. Look over in Romans 7, if you will, and look at verses 24 and 25. Paul cries out almost in despair, if you will, in verse number 24, and he says this, \"'Oh, wretched man that I am! \"'Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?' What does he say? \"'I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.' \"'So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, \"'but with the flesh the law of sin.'\" And he says, I'm thankful to God. Listen, it's God that will give me the victory. It is God that will enable me to live the victorious Christian life. In Romans 8, in verse number 37, again, maybe a page over in your Bible, it says this, \"'Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors.",
