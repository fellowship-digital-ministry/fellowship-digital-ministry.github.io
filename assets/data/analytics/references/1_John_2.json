      "text": "Number one is this, there's a promise of forgiveness. In 1 John chapter number 1 and verse number 9, he says, if we confess our sins, now remember he's writing to save people, so after we're saved, we still sin. Have you sinned since you've been saved? Sure you have. Does that mean that you're not saved? That doesn't mean that you're not saved, but you've sinned since you've been saved. Now you've been saved from the penalty of sin, but you've not yet been saved from the presence of sin. I'm thankful that we've been saved from the power of sin. You don't, you no longer have to sin. Sin no longer has dominion over you, as Paul says in the book of Romans, but we find now that as we, as believers, when there's sin in our life, we have this great promise that if we confess our sins, he, God, is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. That ought to cause us to be thankful this morning, that we have this promise of forgiveness, but not only a promise of forgiveness, but we have the promise in 1 John 2 and verse number 1 that Jesus Christ the righteous is our advocate. The Bible says this in 1 John 2 and verse number 1, my little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not.",

The Bible says this in 1 John 2 and verse number 1, my little children, these things write I unto you that ye sin not. And obviously as a child of God, I ought to desire to live a life of obedience. When we baptize someone, you'll hear it this morning, that you're raised to walk in newness of life. And that desire on the part of a child of God to live a life of obedience, but we still have this flesh and there still will be sin, but our desire should be that we sin not. That's what he says, that you sin not. But then he says this, and if any man sin, we have an advocate. We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And I love this promise in 1 John 2 and verse number 1 that we have an advocate. We really could look at that today and use the terminology of being a defense attorney. And here's the amazing thing, and I said this months ago as we studied 1 John chapter number 2, that Jesus Christ the righteous, our advocate, our defense attorney, he does not argue our innocence. Why? Because we're guilty. How could he argue our innocence if we're guilty?",

      "text": "in verses 5 through 7. We think about what John is relaying here and communicating to these believers that he's writing to. He says, recognize the peril of sin. This is what hinders fellowship. He says at the end of verse number 19, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. No wonder he told us in 1 John 2 that we're to love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. No wonder that James would tell us that loving the world is enmity and that we cannot love the world and love God at the same time and understanding this truth that he would deal with. And we find here that John says, the whole world lieth in wickedness. Notice what else he says about the hindrance to fellowship, recognizing the peril of sin. Verse 21, little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. You say, man, that's an interesting way to end the book of 1 John. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. There's no, you read the Pauline epistles and you read about all the people that Paul saying greet this one and greet that one and so on and so forth, grace and peace and mercy and so on. John says, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. Wow. You know, John is writing from Ephesus. That's where he's writing this book from.",

      "text": "John. Remember, the Bible said this in 1 John chapter number 1 with regard to sin. He says if we say in verse number 8 that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we've not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. And then remember this truth of 1 John 2 in verse number 1, My little children, these things write I unto you that you sin not. That's the goal. Amen? However, I am so thankful for the entirety of verse number 1 of 1 John 2 because the goal is that we sin not. But have you found it in your life that you sin? The goal is to sin not. But the reality is that we sin. You may have sinned this morning. We probably did. Amen? And it says this, and if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. Perfect defense attorney. Amen? Every time the accuser of the brethren brings up charges against us, our advocate, Jesus, says, yes, He's guilty. He doesn't try to defend our innocence for we are guilty. But He says, I paid for it. Isn't that awesome? Yes, He's guilty, but it's under the blood.",

      "text": "speaks of the world, we understand that he speaks of creation as the world. That's not what he's speaking about here in 1 John chapter number 2. When he speaks of the world, there are times in which he speaks about the people. For God so loved the world, right? When he talks about in 1 John 2, in verse number 2, and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. He's talking about the people. That's not what he's speaking about in 1 John 2 and verse number 15 when he says, love not the world. He's not talking about the creation. He's not talking about the people. He's talking about the world system. And the Bible tells us that the God of this world, the little g, the God of this world is Satan himself, and he's speaking about this world system in which we live. As believers, we must acknowledge that this world is not my home. Aren't you thankful for that? That this world system and the way in which it operates and the way in which it's controlled, that this is not my home, that this is not all there is for us. That's a blessing. My citizenship is in heaven. Just like he said in Hebrews 11 and verse number 13, we are strangers and we are pilgrims. I'm not home, but I'm heading home. Isn't that a blessing?",

Just like he said in Hebrews 11 and verse number 13, we are strangers and we are pilgrims. I'm not home, but I'm heading home. Isn't that a blessing? And so this morning as we look at this portion of Scripture in 1 John 2 in verses 15 through 17, I've simply titled the message this morning, love not the world. I want you to notice with me as we begin this morning the progression of worldliness, the progression of worldliness. We find here that he says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him in verse number 15. As we think about this progression of worldliness, we find that this term, speaking about believers and their interaction with the world, is used throughout a number of portions of Scripture. We'll review several of those this morning as we consider this progression of worldliness. But at the onset of the message this morning, I want us to be mindful of this wonderful truth that God gives us in the book of Ephesians, and I hope that it will help us as we begin here in Ephesians 2 to help develop and understand this progression and how we combat it. Notice in Ephesians chapter number 2,",

      "text": "few passages or a few pages in James 1 and verse number 27, notice what he says here, pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, notice what he says, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. You know what happens when I begin to be a friend of the world? I begin to be spotted by the world. So I have no friendship with the world so that I can keep myself unspotted from the world, James 1 and verse number 27, and we find that we then come to 1 John 2 where we see that the Bible says, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. See that love doesn't happen overnight. It's not something that just immediately takes place. There's this progression of worldliness and the reality is that the enemy wants you to be worldly, the enemy wants me to be worldly so that we could be at odds with God so that we can be ineffective in the purpose in which God has left us here. God has left us here to be different. We're not to be like the world. We're not to love the world. He tells us, love not the world. Do you remember Demas? The Bible tells us of Demas, that he hath forsaken me, what does it say? Having loved this present world.",

      "text": "you to notice that the Bible says that Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. He had some level of influence and some level of responsibility, perhaps even being a judge in the city at some level, and the Bible tells us that they, as these two angels came into the city, that Lot sat in the gate. He sat in the gate of Sodom. He didn't get there overnight. He pitched his tent towards Sodom. There was a progression. He dwelt in Sodom, and then now he's sitting in the gate of Sodom. We begin to think about the progression of worldliness this morning, and we find where John says in 1 John 2, love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. Notice what he says, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. Again, strong language. God is being very direct and very strong with regard to this situation, and we must understand that the enemy, again, is constantly trying to allure us by the things of this world, the glitter and the shiny and all of the things of this world. We begin to consider the progression, but now I want you to notice as we continue to make progress through this passage of Scripture, number two this morning, the pitfalls to avoid. I'm thankful for verse number 16. God gives us here in this verse of Scripture some pitfalls to avoid.",

It was pleasant to the eyes. The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes. But notice this as the verse continues, that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired why, to make one wise. So what did she do? She took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. The eyes of them both were open, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons. We're familiar with all that takes place here with the judgment and all that God does and how at the end of the passage He provides for them a coat of skins and the grace and mercy of God that is displayed there, but we find here in verse number 6 exactly what we find in 1 John 2 and verse number 16 when He tells us there's some pitfalls to avoid.
