He saw they've been changed and they turned from their evil way and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not. Of course, we know that in. Zephaniah foretold the destruction of Zephaniah 2, 13 later on down the road. It was rather an interesting situation upon which God brought that destruction. But nonetheless here they repented. They repented. God took His unwilling servant and got him there in spite of Himself and got him there through some very difficult circumstances and put him in a position where he had to deliver the message that God had called him and commissioned him to do and impressed upon him. And he preached an eight word message and these people repented of their sin and revival broke out of the city. See, God loved them and God wanted to give them an opportunity to repent. And it's amazing to me that for whatever reason Jonah just didn't get it. He didn't have a merciful spirit. He was an extremely angry man.
