      "text": "before Joseph and Judah is truly broken. I said this when we preached through the text of Scripture in Genesis 44, that it's a beautiful picture of brokenness and repentance. And we see, listen, when we're broken and we're repentant, guess what we have? We have forgiveness. We have forgiveness. You know, it's interesting as I say that this is kind of a picture, if you will, with regard to the situation there in Genesis 49. And we think about the forgiveness that we have. You know, when God says that He forgives us, He says He removes it as far as the east is from the west. Amen? I'm thankful for that truth. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper. But whoso confesseth and forsaketh, they shall find have mercy, grace. What a blessing. It's interesting. We won't take time, but you could read in Genesis 44, beginning in verse number 14, how Judah stands up and all that he rehearses and all that he says and how he's completely broken. And it was after that speech, if you will, as he pours out his heart and brokenness before Joseph, that Joseph in Genesis 45 could no longer refrain himself and he makes known his identity. Why? Because Judah was broken. He was repentant. We find that here in this text of Scripture, Judah in Genesis chapter 49, back in verses 8, down through verse number 12, we begin to read of this blessing",
