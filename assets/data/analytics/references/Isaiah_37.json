      "text": "what the circumstances are and what has transpired. And we find that as we're looking at our text of scripture this morning and we see this opposition, we see this adversity, I want you to notice first of all this morning, if you are taking notes, notice how they respond. Notice how they respond. I believe this morning that their response is consistent with the response of Hezekiah that we studied last week in Isaiah 37. And we find that what they do in verse number 24 is so important for us to grasp and to understand this morning that they hear what's taking place. Peter and John heard it firsthand, they report it to their own company, they're aware of the threat of the command that has been issued by the religious leaders. By the way, these religious leaders had great power. They had great authority. They didn't have all authority. They didn't have all power. There is one that has all power and all authority, and his name is Jesus. And that's who these disciples were serving, and that's who these disciples were seeking to preach Jesus. And we find that these that had some power and some authority would not cause the disciples to cower in fear. They would not cause the disciples to doubt the power and authority of their Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Rather, we find that their immediate response to the situation is to go to God in prayer.",
