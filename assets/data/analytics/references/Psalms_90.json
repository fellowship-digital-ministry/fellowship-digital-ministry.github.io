I'm not willing to get into a carnal match of wits and of fleshly ambitions as Rachel and Leah find themselves in and seeing my spirituality just disappear. No. I'm walking with my King. And you can't influence my walk with God. Oh, that we'd really be in that place. If we'd be honest this evening, there are times no doubt that external influences do in fact impact our walk with God. I'm not speaking this evening just of the positive influences. I'm speaking primarily of the negative influences. That we allow the behavior of others that we would respond in like manner, that we would go to the same level of carnality as others would deal with and that we would jeopardize our walk with God. It's tragic. It happens so often. Turn to Psalm 90, if you will. I want to look at just a reference here in Psalm 90. Psalm 90 is a prayer of Moses. We don't have time to look at the entirety of the Psalm this evening, but I want you to begin looking with me in verse number nine. He says, for all our days are passed away in thy wrath. We spend our years as a tale that is told. The days of our years are three score years and 10.",
