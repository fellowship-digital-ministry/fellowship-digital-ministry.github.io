It's really recorded in verses 23 through 26, and in verse number 26 it says, or verse 25, it says, they transgressed against the God of their fathers and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land whom God destroyed before them. The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Paul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath",
