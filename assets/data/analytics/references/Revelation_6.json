      "text": "Let me say this, this is none other than the counterfeit, the Antichrist. This is not the Lord Jesus Christ. We find that he will come in Revelation chapter 19, and we read of that passage of Scripture, and the heaven is open in verse number 11 of Revelation 19. I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. That's the return of Jesus Christ at the end of the tribulation. This record of this first seal in Revelation 6, verses 1 and 2, this white horse, this is the counterfeit, this is the rise of Antichrist, which happens after the rapture of the church. Now look at the second seal. In verses 3 and 4, the Bible says, and when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see. And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given unto him, notice this says, a great sword. Now I believe that as you read through the book of Revelation, and you read of the seal judgments, and you read of the trumpet judgments, and you read of the vial or the bowl judgments, that they happen in rapid succession.",
