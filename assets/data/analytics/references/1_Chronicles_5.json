And so as we look at this firstborn son, Reuben, standing before his father, Jacob, we find that he mentions about his place in the birth order, that he's his firstborn. We notice and we could look in 1 Corinthians 5, you might wanna reference it, verses one and two, how that his birthright was forfeited and therefore the genealogy is not to be followed after the Reuben being the firstborn. And we can read of that in 1 Chronicles 5 as the genealogy is given. But we notice in verse number four that Jacob says unstable as water, thou shalt not excel. Those are not words that you wanna hear. Would you agree? I mean, these are not pleasant words. These are not words that one would be desiring to hear. But we find that as you continue to read in verse number four that what happens is there is sin exposed. We find that here in the text of Scripture, something that had happened many years prior, but evidently had never been dealt with is now being exposed. I would say that it seems as you read the Scriptures that there's never a time in recorded Scripture where Reuben has any level of brokenness or repentance. And we find that this sin that had happened many years ago is now being referenced and discussed",

      "text": "make the request to Moses to settle on the east side of the Jordan. They were the ones that they saw the land and said, hey, this is good for us. They settled not for what God had intended for them to have, but they settled for what was convenient. They asked, you could turn over to Numbers 32 and you could see how they settled on the east side of Jordan. Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh. So Reuben is the one that first makes that request. Reuben is the tribe that is first taken into Assyrian captivity. In 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, we'll note that passage of scripture in 1 Chronicles 5, and it's sad because we can read with regard to the, of course, the nation of Israel going into captivity and the nation of Judah going into captivity. But here in 1 Chronicles 5 and verse 26, it begins to record for us the captivity of the two and a half tribes that are on the east side of the Jordan. It's really recorded in verses 23 through 26, and in verse number 26 it says, or verse 25, it says, they transgressed against the God of their fathers and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land whom God destroyed before them. The God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Paul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath",
