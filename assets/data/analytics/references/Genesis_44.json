      "text": "the events being chronological, the situation with Simeon and Levi happened first, then the situation with Reuben and then the situation with Judah. And so I do not think it's a matter of Jacob just forgetting of this situation with Judah and all that took place. No, rather I believe that as we think here of Judah standing before Jacob and this blessing that we read of, that one reason I believe, the reason, that nothing is brought up with regard to what he had previously been guilty of is that when we look at the life of Judah and we look at him standing in Egypt before Joseph, not knowing that it's Joseph, we read in Genesis 44, verses 14 through 34, a man who is broken. A broken man. Over what? Over sin. Just over the sin of the situation with Joseph? I don't think so. Yes. Indeed, that's referenced there. But think about what Judah and even some of the other brothers, what they had said during that period of time. All these things were happening. Surely God is dealing with us. Surely God remembers. And we find that Judah is the one that stands up before Joseph and Judah is truly broken. I said this when we preached through the text of Scripture in Genesis 44, that it's a beautiful picture of brokenness and repentance. And we see, listen, when we're broken and we're repentant, guess what we have? We have forgiveness. We have forgiveness.",

You know, it's interesting as I say that this is kind of a picture, if you will, with regard to the situation there in Genesis 49. And we think about the forgiveness that we have. You know, when God says that He forgives us, He says He removes it as far as the east is from the west. Amen? I'm thankful for that truth. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper. But whoso confesseth and forsaketh, they shall find have mercy, grace. What a blessing. It's interesting. We won't take time, but you could read in Genesis 44, beginning in verse number 14, how Judah stands up and all that he rehearses and all that he says and how he's completely broken. And it was after that speech, if you will, as he pours out his heart and brokenness before Joseph, that Joseph in Genesis 45 could no longer refrain himself and he makes known his identity. Why? Because Judah was broken. He was repentant. We find that here in this text of Scripture, Judah in Genesis chapter 49, back in verses 8, down through verse number 12, we begin to read of this blessing",
