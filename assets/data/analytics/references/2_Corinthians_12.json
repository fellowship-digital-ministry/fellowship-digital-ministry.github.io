      "text": "there are pressures that we face. There are pressures. Listen, you're gonna face pressures in your life. And what you're gonna find in your life, you're never gonna make everyone happy either. Amen? You're not gonna ever make everyone happy. Why do you think your pastor's gonna make everyone happy? It's unreasonable, is it not? Honestly. I like this, I don't like that, I like that. You know how it works. And the reality is that Paul says there's great pressures.

I mean, there's reality, there's truth, there's transparency. And Paul says there's pressures, but let me remind you that though there's great pressures, there's great provision. Why is it great provision? Because it's God's provision. And we find here that if we look and we were to categorize it into two thoughts, that the provision comes first in the form of God's grace. The provision comes first in the form of God's grace. And we're reminded of 2 Corinthians 12 and verse number nine that God's grace is sufficient. That God's grace is sufficient.

Then notice he says, yet not distressed.",
