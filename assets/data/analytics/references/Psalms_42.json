      "text": "those are two prayers that I pray each day when I open up my Bible and I begin to read. I pray those two thoughts from Scripture, Psalm 119 and verse 18, and 1 Samuel 3 and verse 10, because I wanna hear from God. I wanna hear from God. Turn over if you go to Psalm 42, and I want you to see the imagery that God gives us. It's a text that no doubt you're familiar with, but I want you to see it this evening. In Psalm 42, verses one and two, the Bible says, as the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. Notice it says, my soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? I wonder if your soul's ever thirsted for God. You need to hear from God. You need a message from the Lord. You're longing to have that communication from God, and you go to his word and you receive it. Listen, I've read accounts of individuals that have not had the privilege of having a Bible like you and like me. They've been outlawed. There are people that were killed, martyred, burned at the stake simply for having a copy of the Bible. There are people that were Christians living under communist rule, that the communist, even, I mean, I'm talking just 100 years ago. I'm not talking 400 years ago. In portions of Europe,",

      "text": "We find in the 15th chapter of the book of Genesis, in the first verse, God says, Fear not, Abram, why, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. And then the psalmist would say this in Psalm 42, in verses 1 and 2, the song that they just sang, As the heart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God? I wonder this morning how much do we really long for God. Not so that we can get something from God, but just long for God. He's our everything. And as they sang that song, I was so touched, and I know you were as well. He's my heart's desire. You alone. Alone. The singularity of the idea that we're seeking Christ alone. Again, not for what we might get, but just because of who He is. I'm so glad that He saved me. Aren't you glad that He saved you this morning? We sang a little bit about being saved this morning. I hope this morning that you know for sure that heaven's your home. If not, we'd love to take a Bible and show you how that when you take your final breath here on earth, that you can be in the presence of Almighty God, knowing for sure that heaven is your home. Well, that was all free this morning.",
