And we see that the result of that as it's revealed to us in Proverbs 16 in verse number 18, where the Bible says a familiar verse of scripture, pride goeth before destruction and in haughty spirit before a fall. We see this in the life of Nebuchadnezzar. We see that he's lifted up and look at what I've done. Look at what I've accomplished. Only by pride cometh or pride goeth before destruction. And we find that in Nebuchadnezzar's life,",
