We understand that as we look at the truth of the New Testament, Jesus said in Matthew 28 before His ascension, all power is given unto Me. He gives the great commission. And He says, lo, I am with you always. Hebrews 13 and v. 5, a precious promise of the Word of God. He will never leave thee nor forsake thee. When we understand the truth of v. 6, He is my Helper. Therefore, who or what am I going to fear? The psalmist said in Psalm 121, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills. From whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth. He is my Helper. He's your Helper. And here, these men, they find themselves in the fiery furnace, they find themselves enjoying some communion with God. Can I tell you this morning that if you're going to stand and if I'm going to stand, we may face some consequences. But can I tell you, God will be with you. God will be with you. And you'll have seasons of communion that are sweeter than you've ever enjoyed any time before. I think about Paul and Silas when they were in prison. They were cast into the prison fast, locked away. But man, they were singing, were they not? Singing to God, they were having communion with God. See, this morning,",

When we look at these promises of God that we've looked at in the New Testament, and we are mindful that over and over that God says to his people, fear not, be not afraid. Over and over and over we read those words in this precious book. I'm mindful of the truth of Hebrews 13, in verses 5 and 6, the Bible says in Hebrews 13 verse 5, let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as you have, completely different message in that portion of verse number 5, but notice what he says at the end of verse number 5, for he hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, isn't that precious? But you know what the result of that understanding is, is verse number 6, so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Why is it that you do not have any fear? Because the Lord is my helper, the Lord is my helper, and he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee. Remember Psalm 121, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help? My help cometh from the Lord, notice this, which made heaven and earth. Now how did he make it? He spoke and it was so, amen?",

The power of creation, and he's my helper, he's your helper, he's Nehemiah's helper. How could Nehemiah continue with all that was going on? I mean day after day after day, the work being opposed and all of the adversity, he's a man of prayer. He learned how to recognize the enemy. He learned how to resist the enemy, and I believe that as we look at the completion of the wall, we rejoice in the work of God. This morning I pray that God would help us to recognize the enemy and to resist the enemy and to keep on keeping on. One day it's all going to be over, whether it's by death or by rapture, it's going to be over. But until then, oh that God would help us. to just press on and say, look, I'm not looking for some cave to run to and hide in. I'm not. People want to move to Idaho and wherever else they want to move to, we're 16 miles from the White House. Oh, man, we're in the thick of it, amen? Come on.",

Woe to them, verse number 1, that go down to Egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots. Why are they trusting in chariots? Because there aren't any. And in horsemen, because why? They're very strong. But they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord. Verse 2, yet He also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back His words, but will rise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity. Now the Egyptians, notice what God says here in verse number 3. Now the Egyptians are men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit. When the Lord shall stretch out His hand, both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is hopin' shall fall down and they shall fail together. He says, woe to them that go down to Egypt for help. They look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord. The psalmist says in Psalm 121, we used it as a theme verse a couple of years ago. I will lift up mine eyes into the hills from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.",

And the little group that I was in this morning, I didn't offer a whole lot in the Sunday school time when we sat around the table. I asked some questions to try to promote some thinking, but I really didn't help them fill out some things. But one of the words that was on the list, the table that I was with in Sunday school this morning under the letter H was helper. He's my helper. And there are a bunch of little kids at our table. And I was excited to hear them put together and to have that idea. Joseph was there and Holly and I, and then some younger children there. And what a blessing. Listen, God is my helper. I don't need to run down to Egypt for help. And let me say this to you this evening, and I'm saying this to myself as well. And you understand, I said this when I prayed this morning.
