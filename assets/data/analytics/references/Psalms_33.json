I need to be reminded of it And as I begin to rehearse those things and I begin to consider the the the references in the Word of God that teach me Who he is and define for us his character It caused me to get into that spirit of praising and worshiping. Oh We ought to praise God for who he is. We ought to praise God for what he's done That song for all he's done God's done some great things for us And what a blessing to to consider the fact that we praise him not only for who he is",

And we can say we understand with absolute certainty what happened in the garden in Genesis 3. Why? Because God's given us a record. He's given us a pure record. The psalmist said this in Psalm 33 in verse number 14. Notice what the Bible says, excuse me, verse number 4 in Psalm 33 and verse number 4. For the word of the Lord is right and all his works are done in truth. I'm thankful this morning that I can trust this book. It's pure. Every word of God is pure. And we couple that and we understand that all scripture is given by inspiration of God. And since all scripture is given by inspiration of God, this is the word of God and God's word is pure. It is a trustworthy, reliable record that God has given to us. And that's the product of inspiration. Not only is it pure, we would say this, this book, the Bible, is incapable of error. It's incapable of error. By the way, I'm thankful for that truth. We live in a time today that so many people want to say, well, this is an error and that's an error and there's a problem over here. I read a theologian of yesteryear many, many years ago. I don't remember who it was at this point.",

I know you're great, but we just simply scratch the surface of your greatness. I pray this morning that you'd help us to just get our attention focused upon thee. Help us to be thankful for your person, for who you are. Help us to be thankful for your presence. There's one that's not sure of heaven. God, it's our prayer that today they'd be saved. They don't know who Jesus is. They've not believed, and therefore they've not concluded that he's precious. Today is the day of salvation. There'd be one that's in that condition. Oh, God, would you move and work, draw them to yourself as only you can. Pray that the Holy Spirit of God would convict of sin and judgment of Christ's righteousness. I pray, Father, that you'd be with each of your people here this morning. Would you help us to just get our eyes upon you and say, as the psalmist said in Psalm 33, I stand in awe of you. Move and work as only you can, for it's in Christ's name we pray. Would you stand with me? Heads are bowed, eyes are closed. It's our custom to have an invitation at the end",

Maybe this morning you're not sure of heaven, and we could take a Bible and show you how you could know for sure that heaven's your home. As Kimberly plays, the altar is open.",

When you understand who He is, it really changes your life. And we find that because the psalmist understood the Lord is my rock, and he goes through and lists all of the things that God is to him, notice the response. Notice the result of understanding who God is. I will call upon the Lord. You're going to call upon Him because you understand who He is. You're going to call upon Him because you understand what He can do. And we find the psalmist says, who is worthy to be praised, so shall I be saved from my enemies. Look down and look at v. 30. The Bible says this, ask for God, His way is perfect. Very similar to what we just read in 2 Samuel 22 and v. 31. The Word of the Lord is tried. He is a buckler to all those that trust in Him. Psalm 28 and v. 7. The Lord is my strength and my shield. My heart trusted in Him and I am helped. Therefore, my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will I praise Him. Psalm 33 and v. 20. Our soul waiteth for the Lord. He is our help and our shield. I'm so thankful. There are many other references that we could look at this evening.",

For sake of time, we'll stop there with looking at the references, but I want you to just rejoice this evening in understanding that as Abram is given this truth, this revelation from God of who God is, He comes after those things, after those events, and in that time when Abram needed to hear this Word from God and Abram receives this first statement, fear not, I am thy shield. We can rejoice in understanding that God is our protector. He's our protection. And by the way, no one can protect you like God can protect you. Amen? I'm thankful for that this evening. There are times in which God protects us and we might not even know what He's protecting us from. We're completely blinded and oblivious to it. There are times in which He will allow us to see how He was protecting us. But I see here with Abram, and we understand again the things that we dealt with last week as we finish up the 14th chapter and how Abram is receiving that revelation from Melchizedek, understanding that God, remember we said that He's the Most High God.
