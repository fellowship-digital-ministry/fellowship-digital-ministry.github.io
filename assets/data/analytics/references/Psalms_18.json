But sometimes in the midst of those hardships, God's proving Himself and God's developing His children and God's allowing for His glory to be known to those that are watching. If thy strength fail in the day of adversity, if thy faith fail in the day of adversity, thy strength is small. See this morning, we understand that His way is perfect. You can see in Psalm 18, it's the similar passage that we see in 2 Samuel 22, but not only is His way perfect, but He always does right. We cannot say of ourselves that we always do the right thing. In fact, there are many times that we mess things up. Many of our difficulties are the result of our own doing. We just mess things up. But the Bible tells us that God always does what's right. Notice in Genesis 18 and verse 25, in Genesis 18 and verse 25, the Bible tells us in this text of Scripture a great truth. Notice what the Bible says in Genesis 18 and verse 25, that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee. But then notice at the end of the verse, shall not the judge of all the earth do right?",
