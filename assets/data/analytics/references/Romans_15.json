      "text": "the Lord, then I can look at some examples from history and I can say, okay, here's some behavior that is to be avoided. We, of course, are reminded that Paul would tell the believers in Rome, as he's writing there in the book of Romans, in chapter number 15, you don't need to turn there, but the things that were written aforetime were written for our learning in Romans 15 and verse number four. So behavior to be avoided. Let me give you some behavior that is appropriate. We don't see it here in 1 Corinthians chapter number 10, but I want you to just turn quickly over to Exodus chapter number 40. And I wanna use this example this evening from history of some appropriate behavior in which God was pleased. And again, I hope that it would be a lesson that we'd learn from history as we look at this passage of scripture. I do not have the time to go through all of the verses of Exodus chapter number 40, so you'll have a little homework this evening. And I trust it'll be an enjoyable exercise for you. As you look at Exodus chapter number 40, you're going to find in this passage of scripture that all of the work of the tabernacle, all of the pieces of furniture, everything's been completed. And it's here in Exodus chapter number 40 that the tabernacle was reared up. And we find that the Bible uses some repetition here",
