      "text": "of the serpent in Genesis chapter number three, that he was more subtle than any beast of the field. We find that it's in verse number 12 of the same passage in Ephesians six that Paul says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. I believe that as we look here in Nehemiah chapter number six it reminds me as we think about the deception increasing and we think about the attacks in which Nehemiah would deal with the opposition to the work, it reminds me of what we read back in the book of Numbers under the counsel of Balaam. Remember that Balaam could not curse the people of God. Though Balak wanted him to, we find that it was through the counsel of Balaam that he encouraged the people of God to corrupt themselves. You can read that in Numbers 31 and verse number 16. We also find that it's very similar to what you read of in the book of Joshua in the ninth chapter with the deception of the Gibeonites. And we find that our enemy is going to consistently and regularly increase the deception because he's our enemy. Understand as we look at this point this morning that we need to learn to recognize the enemy, we need to understand the objective of the enemy.",
