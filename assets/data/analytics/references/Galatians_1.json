And then corporately as we serve God together, we give account for that, but the reality is that we need to know our place. We need to know our course. Know our ministry. We're not going to fulfill it if we don't know what it is. I'm so thankful that Paul, he understood. I mentioned already that when you read many of the epistles, that you find that Paul mentions about the receiving of the ministry and how God had called him. In fact, don't turn there, but in Galatians 1, I want you to see that Paul says this, I neither received it, speaking of the gospel of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ in Galatians 1 and verse 12. So when we know what God's will is, when we know what God's plan is and what our ministry and our course is, that's going to go a long way to us running and finishing and fulfilling our ministry. Because if I don't know what it is, ever gonna know if I finished it? I know that's on the very low shelf, amen? But it's super practical. I got to know it or I'm not gonna do it. I show up to the wrong racetrack. You had a track meet yesterday, a basketball game yesterday.",
