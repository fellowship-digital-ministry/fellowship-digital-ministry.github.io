      "text": "the Apostle Paul is going to speak with great transparency in this portion of Scripture. In fact, in the book of 2 Corinthians, he not only speaks here, but he speaks again in chapter number 11 and again in chapter number 12 with great transparency with regard to the pressures that he experienced. We understand this morning that life is full of pressure and here for just a few verses, we have the opportunity to get a glimpse into what the Apostle Paul experienced. I would say this, that he had physical pressures. He had emotional pressures. I would say this, he had external pressures, but he had internal pressures. And begin to think about the pressures that the Apostle Paul faced, we find and we won't take the time to read it in 2 Corinthians 11, but in verses 24 through 28, Paul lists out a whole lot of things that he suffered and that he dealt with and those difficulties. He ends it at the end of verse 28 and talks about that which came upon him daily, the care of all the churches. He says in the 12th chapter of the book of 2 Corinthians, he says in verse number 14 and 15, behold, the third time I am ready to come to you and I will not be burdensome to you for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",

      "text": "Jude makes this statement only one chapter in the book of Jude, but we find that he says this in v. 3, that it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints. Why? For there are certain men crept in unawares. We're familiar with the terminology that it's a wolf in sheep's clothing. We're understanding the way in which the enemy is deceitful and the enemy tries to come in and seeks to identify themselves as being maybe one of us, of seeking to deceive us through their approach. Remember, the apostle Paul said to the believers in Corinth in 2 Corinthians 11, in v. 13, he says, for such are false apostles, deceitful workers, notice what he says that they do, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel. And no marvel. For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore, it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works. John says that we're to try the spirits. We find here that the enemy, the adversaries as they're noted in v. 11, that they say, here's what we're going to do. They're not even going to know what happened. They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease.",
