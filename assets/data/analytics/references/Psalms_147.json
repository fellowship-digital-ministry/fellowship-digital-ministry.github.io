He's the one that's created us, He knows us, and He's given us the Word of God to reveal Himself to us. And we find that as we understand this infinite God that transcends us, that He would desire to have a relationship with us as human beings. It's amazing. It's amazing that God would love us, that God would care so much about us, that God would want us to know who He is. And I think about the statement of Moses, and I think about the statement of Paul when they both expressed their desire to know God. And I think about the truth of if we really want to know God, we need to know His Word, and we dig into His Word, and we accept by faith what God has told us in His Word regarding who He is. And notice what Psalm 147 says, we'll read that verse and I'll get into some thoughts tonight. Psalm 147 and verse number 5, notice here what the psalmist says, again we would be mindful that just a couple of psalms before, the Bible talks to us about the fact that",

Psalm 147 and verse number 5, notice here what the psalmist says, again we would be mindful that just a couple of psalms before, the Bible talks to us about the fact that our God is a great God and that His greatness is unsearchable. But then notice here in Psalm 147, it starts out by giving the truth of praising the Lord. Praise you the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for it is pleasant and praise is comely. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem, He gathereth together the outcasts of Israel, He healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds, He telleth the number of the stars, He calleth them all by their names. Now that's an amazing statement of God's Word, is it not? There's this new, Ronnie what's the new telescope called? No, that's the old one. What is it? James Webb? Have any of you seen any of the images that have come back from that thing? Amazing, right? And it's causing a lot of people to be like, oh, maybe what we thought isn't really true. A lot of scientists that believe the Big Bang all of a sudden are thinking, hmm. It's phenomenal. And here our God says that He telleth the number of the stars, He calleth them all by their names.",
