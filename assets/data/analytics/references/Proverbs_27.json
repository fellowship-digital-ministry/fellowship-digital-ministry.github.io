Today is the day of salvation. Today is the day of salvation. We know not what's on the morrow, according to Proverbs 27. What is your life? It's a vapor that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away. And this morning, if you're not sure of heaven, if you've not received the gift of God, which is eternal life, this Christmas season, why don't you receive the greatest gift, the perfect gift, the gift of God, which is eternal life. This morning, if you've already received that gift, what's our gift in return to him? How are we praising him? Are we lifting his name? Are we exalting him the way that we should? Have we given him our lives? Not to earn our salvation, not to keep it. We can't earn it or keep it. But because of what he's done for us, have we offered him our lives? How's our testimony? Who are we bringing to Jesus? Who are we saying, let me tell you about this gift, this gift of God. Let me tell you what he did for you, or what he did for me and what he can do for you. Let me tell you how he changed my life",
