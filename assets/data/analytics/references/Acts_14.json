And John the Baptist, it says here in Acts 13, that as John fulfilled his course, he ran his race. He finished. He fulfilled his ministry. In Acts 14, in verse number 26, notice this is the end of the first missionary journey. I've often referred to this passage of Scripture at the end of Acts 14 as the first missions conference when the missionaries come back and they report of all that God has done and how God has worked. But you'll see in verse number 26 that the Bible says this, and then sailed to Antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled. You know that when Paul is used by God to write the book of Galatians, that that book is not written to a single church of Galatia, it is written to the churches in Galatia that are the churches that were established during the first missionary journey. They fulfilled their work. They fulfilled what God had called them to do. If you were to take the time to go back to Acts 13 in the first few verses, you see how that God called them and said, separate me, Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called them.",
