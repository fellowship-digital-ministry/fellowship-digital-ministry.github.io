How many times do you hear people say, follow your heart? You've heard people say that? Do you know that's a bad idea? Honestly. You know why it's a bad idea? Turn to the book of Proverbs, if you will. Proverbs chapter 28. It's not a bad idea because I'm saying it's a bad idea. It's a bad idea because God told us it was a bad idea. Amen? Because our heart is deceitful above all things. I've heard people say, follow your heart. I'm just following my heart. I've heard people say, I'm following my gut. I'm not sure that's a good idea either. But the reality is that you hear this thing about. following your heart. But notice what it says in Proverbs 28. Look in verse number 25. He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife. But notice what it says. He that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat. Continue, verse 26. He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool. Is that what your Bible says? I'm not making it up, amen? That's what the Word of God says. But whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.",

      "text": "search the Scriptures, let's understand what the Word of God says. And we find, he says, take fast hold here of instruction. Let her not go. Keep her, for she is thy life. In Proverbs 13, in verse number 1, the Bible says, a wise son heareth his father's instruction. But I want you to think about that truth and couple it with chapter 28, in verse number 7, whoso keepeth the law is a wise son. So now listen, if you look at Proverbs 13, in verse number 1, it says a wise son heareth his father's instruction. So we get some information about a wise son. What does he do? He hears the instruction. But we understand some more information about a wise son in Proverbs 28, in verse number 7, whoso keepeth the law is a wise son. So it's not just hearing, it's keeping, it's doing. We think about the application for us this morning. We see the truth that God's given us good doctrine. He's given us the written Word of God. He's given us the living Word of God. And how is it that we respond? Are we hearing the instruction? Are we understanding that this book is profitable? That I need the content of this book every day of my life? I don't just need the Bible when I have a problem. In fact, if we get a regular routine of getting into the Word of God,",
