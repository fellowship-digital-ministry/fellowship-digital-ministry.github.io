What is the result when we live a life that is surrendered to the Lord? Well, I believe, first of all, the Lord is magnified. The Lord is magnified. Listen, in our lives, in your life and in my life, we ought to desire nothing more, nothing less, but then for Jesus Christ alone to be magnified, to be exalted. You know how that's achieved? You know how that's accomplished? By living a life of surrender, by living a life of surrender. Because through living that life of surrender, which results in obedience and submission to the Lord, it leads to a place of God being magnified. Let God be magnified. You read that in Psalm 70. Let God be magnified. You read that John the Baptist, he said, he must increase, I must decrease.",

And the idea this morning that we desire that through our lives that the Lord Jesus Christ would be magnified. I said this by way of introduction that when we struggle with the idea, when our response of resisting the idea of surrender, that it leads to great struggle in the life of a believer and it hinders our effectiveness for the Lord.
