You know what's so frustrating is when we try, when we try to live the Christian life in our own power, in our own strength, and we try to live it in our own flesh, and it's frustrating, but He promised that He would empower us. We find in Acts 1.8 as He says to the disciples as they're there after they had heard this great commission and before they would go, of course, to the ascension and then wait for the promise of the Father. We find that Jesus says, but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you. I'm thankful for the empowering of Christ. I'm thankful that He's promised to empower us, that it's not in my flesh. Remember, Paul said, I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present. But then how do we accomplish that, right? Oh, woe is me, oh wretched man that I am. And we find here that He's promised to empower us that we're to be filled with the Spirit of God. Ephesians 5 and verse number 18, be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit of God. And we understand that importance of daily being filled with His Spirit. The Bible says in Galatians 5, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.",
