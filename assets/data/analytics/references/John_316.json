      "text": "end of the text that Jesus will speak about loving one another as he loved them. But he says in John 13 in verse number one, it says this, having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. I'm thankful tonight that there's nothing that can separate me from the love of God. I'm thankful for that. It caused us to rejoice in that. He loved us, he continues to love us. Notice in first John, again, as we reference various passages that God used the apostle John to pin with the similar subject in first John three in verse number 16, by the way, it's an interesting study to see John 316 next to first John 316, for the Bible says in first John 316, hereby perceive we the love of God. How is it that we perceive the love of God? Because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. He laid down his life for us. John talks about in John chapter number 10, Jesus says I am the good shepherd. And he says that the good shepherd, what does the good shepherd do? He gives his life for the sheep. See, no one's gonna take it from him. In fact, even while he was on the cross of Calvary, you understand that the Bible says that he gave up the ghost. He gave up the ghost.",
