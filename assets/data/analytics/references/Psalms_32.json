      "text": "his precious word will impact how we pray. We pray that God will move mountains because he can, because he's God, because he has all power, because he's reigning and ruling. We pray that God would save sinners because he's able. And you think about the way that we pray, it's based upon what we believe to be true about God's word, about who God is. We find that we've looked at David, the life of David in Psalm 32. We look at the life of Daniel. Why did Daniel have such confidence in praying that God would show him not only the dream, but the interpretation of the dream, because he knew who God was. He knew who God was. And therefore he prayed that God would give an answer. And guess what God did. And Daniel did not stand before Nebuchadnezzar and say that I'm able. He said, there's a God in heaven and praise the Lord. He's still there. He rules and he reigns and he's able. We had the opportunity to look at the life of Paul. And we dealt with the subject matter of a life marked by prayer. And we looked at his life. And as we were challenged through those messages to examine our own prayer lives, and in order to determine how our prayer lives have been shaped, have been impacted by what God has given to us in his word about how great he is.",
