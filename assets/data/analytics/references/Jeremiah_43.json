It's one thing for us to say we're going to agree with God, it's another thing that we agree with God, that we take and we apply the truth that God has given to us in His word. Unfortunately, this group of people in Jeremiah 43, they did not obey the voice of the Lord, they did not obey the message that God delivered through His man Jeremiah, and it's a sad reality, but we find that even today, even as we look back at Hebrews chapter 2, that it says this, and again, the last part of that first verse, he says this, therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. Why do they slip? Is it that we don't remember them, or is it that we just simply don't want to hearken unto the voice of the Lord? You know, we live in a society where a lot of people want to do what they want to do. They want to be their own authority, their own boss, their own person, and as believers, as Christians, we submit to the authority of this book. Say, God, it's your word, I want to hear from you. I want to give the more earnest heed. I don't want it to just, I'm not looking for my ears being tickled,",
