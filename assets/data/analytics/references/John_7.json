      "text": "yet is so important because He does go up, but in so many of the modern versions, it's missing, and they then bring the charge that Jesus lied because He said He wasn't going, and then He did go. And so we find that He says, I'm not going yet. And so He knew, and by the way, even as He gets there and He begins to say about those that were desiring to kill Him, there was some objection to the claim, but we know what was taking place. And so He walked wisely. Turn over to John 11, if you will, just a few chapters over, John chapter number 11. Look if you will here as we see what's taking place, again, in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. And verse number 54, I'll just pick it up right in the middle here, and again, the same similar context and idea of what we saw in John 7. Here in John chapter 11 and verse 54, Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but went fenced into a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with His disciples. And so was it that He did not walk openly in John chapter number 7 and verse number 1? Is it that He, here in John chapter 11 and verse 54, that He didn't walk openly among the Jews because He was fearful? No, it's because He was wise.",
