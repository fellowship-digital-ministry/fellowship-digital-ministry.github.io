      "text": "to bring judgment. And Elijah stood before this wicked king who was the son of Amorai. And it said that of Amorai, that he did worse than all that were before him. And so Amorai was the worst of the worst. And then came Ahab and did even more wickedly than his father did. I mean, it was a dim time in Israel's history. It was a dark time full of idolatry and wickedness and all sorts of things that were contrary to God's word. We find that as we read 1 Kings 17 and 18, really a quick read of those two chapters, give us much information about the life of Elijah. We won't take time this evening to deal with it. We're gonna really focus on chapter 19 this evening. But as you study chapter 17 and 18 of 1 Kings, you find that the prophet Elijah served the Lord God Almighty faithfully and courageously. I love the courage and the faith, the faithfulness of Elijah and how he served the Lord during this very difficult time in Israel's history. And we find that it was through his hands that God would work miracles and we find amazing things that happen. But as you begin reading 1 Kings chapter 19, you find that things change considerably. The high point, if you will, in chapter 18 is there at Mount Carmel when fire, God sends fire from heaven to consume the offering and the prophets of Baal are destroyed.",
