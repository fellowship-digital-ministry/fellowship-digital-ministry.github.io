However, we would find that the sacrificial offering of Jesus Christ once for all offers remission for sin. What a blessing to think about the remission of sin and the fact that we have that truth. In fact, Romans 3 deals with that. We see how that we have this great truth and we see what he obtained for us, eternal redemption. By the way, there's nothing you can do to add to what Jesus already took care of. Amen? He's paid it all. There are people that live on this earth today that are trying somehow to earn their own righteousness, to make it their own way, and to follow some creed or some religion. But the reality is that Jesus, after He made one sacrifice for sin forever, when He entered into the holy place once with His blood, He obtained for us eternal redemption. For us. So we find that He's writing to believers, these Jewish believers. Of course, as we're reading it this morning, as those that have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, you can rejoice in the fact that you have eternal redemption, aren't you thankful that you're redeemed? We sing the song, Redeemed? How I love to proclaim it. Redeemed how? There's only one way, by the blood of the Lamb. Right?",
