      "text": "about what Jesus said in Matthew chapter number 6. In Matthew chapter number 6, verses 20 and 21, Jesus says this. I'll read verse number 19 along with it. In Matthew 6, verses 19 through 21. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.
