But I want you to consider with me this morning as we think about some foundational truth with regard to prayer, I would say this. We must be mindful of the fact that an invitation has been extended. Prayer is the unique privilege that is reserved for the child of God. God Almighty has extended an invitation to you and to me and to every one of his people to enter into his presence. What a great invitation. Remember the words that he spoke to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 33, call unto me. Right, isn't that wonderful? This invitation that the God of the universe, God Almighty, my heavenly Father, he says call unto me. And then he says this, and I will answer thee. Isn't that precious? And show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not. Consider the words of Jesus in Matthew 7. He says, ask and it shall be given unto you. Seek and ye shall find. Knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth. Do you remember what James says? You have not because you ask not. He also says you have not because you ask amidst. But I want you to think about what Jesus says. For everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth",
