And he went and he published it, the Bible tells us, in Decapolis, and the people marveled. They saw what was happening. They saw the power of God on display. And this evening, we are His ambassadors, we're His representatives. Second Corinthians 5 and verse number 20 tells us that we are His ambassadors. This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through. My citizenship is in heaven. I happen to be a United States citizen, and this is my mission field. It is my responsibility to reach this place with the gospel. Psalm 126, I want you to see these verses of Scripture, and then I'll get some assistance here in just a moment to pass these cards out. We'll use that by way of our invitation this evening. In Psalm 126, in verses 5 and 6, I want you to see what the Bible says here. \"'They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.'\" I wonder, when's the last time we've really prayed for lost souls? When's the last time we've wept over lost souls? The weeping. The Bible says of Paul, you don't need to turn there, but in Acts 20 and verse 31,",
