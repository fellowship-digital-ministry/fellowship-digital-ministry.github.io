And the question specifically is from the second chapter, a reference in verse number 15 specifically. But really, instead of just jumping right into that verse of Scripture, give a little bit of a background, if you will, to the book of Hosea. I believe the book of Hosea is a fascinating book.

And this man, Hosea, was called of the Lord to minister, to prophesy to the ten northern tribes, the tribe of Israel. We find that Hosea 1.1 provides for us the timing of his ministry. The Bible says in Hosea 1, in verse number 1, the word of the Lord that came unto Hosea, the son of Berei, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. So God helps us understand who's reigning in Judah during the time of Hosea's ministry, though his ministry is specifically predominantly to the northern tribes, not to Judah. And then it tells us, and in the days of Jeroboam,",
