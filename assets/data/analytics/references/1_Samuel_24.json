      "text": "with Saul. By the way, God was able to deal with Saul, was he not? And Saul did go into battle and did not return from battle. We find that God took care of Saul. Interference between these two events in the life of David is 1 Samuel chapter 25. And in 1 Samuel 25, I believe that God records for us a significant interaction between David and Abigail that helps us with understanding this whole process of not taking matters into our own hands. In Genesis chapter 34, there was a wrong that was committed. There was evil that took place against Dinah. Jacob's sons, the brothers of Dinah, they were grieved and they were full of wrath and they were angry over what had taken place. They were right in their assessment that this thing ought not to be done. But they took matters into their own hands and they made a mess of the situation. We find that David, in 1 Samuel 24, God gives an opportunity when Saul enters into the cave and David says, no, I'm going to resist that. I'm going to trust the Lord. In 1 Samuel chapter 26, God gives another opportunity and Abishai says, let me just smite him once. David says, no, I'm going to trust the Lord. But in 1 Samuel 25, there's a different event that takes place that's not with Saul. See, Saul was the Lord's anointed.",
