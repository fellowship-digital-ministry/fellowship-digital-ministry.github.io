It's interesting, he said that it would be within the space of two full years, but if you read verse number 16, it says, therefore, thus saith the Lord, behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth. This year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. God dealt with him. It was severe judgment. But I just think about that passage of Scripture and the antics of Hananiah and the way in which he's breaking that yoke. I mean, certainly the people would be excited about hearing something like that. He's saying that he's speaking the word of the Lord, but God says, no, I didn't give him this message. We see that the desire of these antichrists, the desire of these false teachers is to seduce, to deceive. Remember this truth in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 13, the Bible says, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.

Remember this truth in 2 Timothy 3, in verse number 13, the Bible says, but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. On Wednesday evenings, several, I don't know, last year in the fall, I preached a series for a couple of months on the danger of deception. The way in which we read all throughout the word of God, the warning has been given to us with regard to this age of deception in which we're living. We find that these false teachers that are mentioned here, the exposure of false teaching, he gives a description, he gives their doctrine and then he speaks of their desire. As we move forward this morning, I want you to think not only of the exposure of false teaching, but I want you to consider number two, the enabling of the believer, the enabling of the believer. I'm thankful that there's a great contrast in these verses of Scripture with regard to the behavior of the false teacher, the behavior of the Antichrist, that spirit of Antichrist versus the behavior of the believer. The reality is that in verse number 20, the Bible says, but we, excuse me, but ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know it. all things.\" Notice, in verse number 27, it says, \"...but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you.

You say, well, if I believe this that they said, they were so convincing in what they said over here, and I didn't believe it when I first started. But now all of a sudden I understand where they're coming from. Be careful. We must examine the source. We must know. Listen, what do they believe? If they don't believe in creation, if they don't believe that God is the creator, if they don't believe that He died for all people, if they don't believe that Jesus is the only way to heaven, if they don't believe, we could just keep going through the fundamentals of the faith. Listen, don't fill your mind with it. It ministers questions. It's vain jangling.

And then they're a Christian and they go and listen to terrible false teaching. You say, what's going on here? You examine the source with regard to the meat that you're going to eat, but you don't even care about the stuff you're listening to? It's dangerous. And Paul gives a warning. He says we have to be selective. When it comes to our spiritual diet, when we ask ourselves how's our diet spiritually speaking, we must be selective. Number two, I took a long time on number one, but we'll get through it. Amen. Number two, you must, you must be scriptural. You must be selective, but you must be scriptural.

It tells us, study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of truth. I gotta read it if I'm gonna study it. 1 Peter 2 and verse number two says, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. 2 Timothy 3 and verse 18 says, but grow in grace in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honor forever and ever. Amen. This book produces growth in God's people. And so the question this evening with regard to Bible reading is will we make a commitment to God perhaps to read the book of Proverbs each month, perhaps to read the New Testament in one year, perhaps to read the entirety of God's Word in one year, and make that commitment to God? You say, well, I already do that. Good. Continue. Maybe add to it. I change it up year by year. I think it was in 2018. I read the Bible through twice, but I read the book of Psalms every month. It requires that you read five Psalms a day, and you do that, and you get through the whole book of Psalms each month.",

We know that the chapter divisions were inserted later for our ease of being able to find and reference portions of Scripture. But he gives a charge to begin the fourth chapter, and he says this in verse number two, preach the word. Why? Because of what he just told us the word is. And this morning, as we begin to think about this truth of holding in our hands the precious Bible, someone said this, I thought it was just so perfect how they summarized this truth, referring to the Bible as the word of God is the most complete and impressive acknowledgement of its significance, reminding us that we should regard the Bible as God speaking to man. It's God's word. This message from God to humanity is the most powerful and trustworthy book ever written. God assures us throughout the Bible that these are His very words. I'm thankful this morning that God's given us a Bible.

And it's interesting because Peter is the human penman to the book of 2 Peter, containing his name here in the particular epistle. He is the human penman, but remember all Scripture is given by inspiration of God. And as Peter is writing in this particular passage of Scripture, we'll actually visit this passage again in a few weeks and look at this passage in its entirety. But notice what Peter is saying.

Over 1,500 years, 40 different people, three different languages, three different continents and you have one complete perfect book. Why? Because of the author. Because inspiration reveals the greatness of God. That God is able to take the different personalities of the human penmen and he's able to communicate his very word to us. It's amazing.

We find that the book of Titus is written, if you were to read just the first chapter and enter just a couple of verses in the second chapter of the book of Titus, you'll find three or four different references that Paul is making to Titus about sound doctrine.
