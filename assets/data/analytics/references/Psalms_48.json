As you know, you see on the banners there, great is the Lord, and then it says this, and greatly to be praised, Psalm 48, verse number one. We've been singing as our theme song, Psalm 48, one and two all year.

Each of us would, I believe, agree this morning that our God is great. We wanna be able to have some substance as to why we would make that claim. Why is it that we would tell somebody else that our God is great? What sets him apart? And so as we've studied for all of these months, and we've looked at so many various subjects and passages of scripture, topics, as to why our God is great, and we've discovered God's greatness, phase two is going to be this, declare God's greatness. And you'll remember with me as we began studying this year with this theme that I made note that the psalmist made two powerful statements really with regard to the greatness of God as it relates to our theme for this year. And one of those is in Psalm 135, in verse number five, where the psalmist said this,",

In Numbers 14, verses 11 through 20, I wanna read to you by way of introduction, verse 18 and 19, and then we'll get into the message this morning. But notice in Numbers 14, verse number 18, the Bible says this, this is Moses now talking back to the Lord, the Lord is long-suffering, is recalling what God has said, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. Notice this in verse 19, pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now. You'll notice there right in the midst of verse number 19, according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and I've used that as the title for the message this morning. We've spent the calendar year of 2023 talking about the truth that our God is great, and I'm so thankful that his greatness is revealed to us in the pages of this precious book, and what a blessing it is to know great is the Lord and greatly to be praised, as we sang from Psalm 48, verses one and two this morning,",

What is it that would cause you, that would cause me to say God is great? And then, as we enter into the latter part of the year, we'll deal with the subject of declaring his greatness. Of course, that was the theme for our missions conference just a couple of weeks ago, and we'll spend several messages at the end of this year. Now that we have discovered the greatness of God, we ought to be declaring the greatness of God. This morning in this text of scripture, we find that Moses makes reference to the greatness of God's mercy, and it's a blessing to consider that our God is merciful.",
