          "context": "and I mean, just live it up because this is all there is. I'm sorry, but God tells us that there is eternity. And the most precious thing is that God is the author of eternal salvation. We find that He offers that eternal life. You're here living this morning. You have breath and life and none of us know how long we will have to live, but I hope this morning you're sure of heaven. You've trusted the Lord Jesus Christ, your personal savior and received the gift of life, which is eternal life, or the gift of God, which is eternal life. Notice here, as we think about the blessing of this Shunammite woman in Psalm 113 and verse number nine, the Bible says, He, speaking of God, He maketh the barren woman to keep her house, and to be a joyful mother of children, praise ye the Lord. What a blessing. In Psalm 127, in verse number three, a verse of Scripture that's familiar to many of us, the Bible says, Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is His reward. The Bible continues in verses four and five and says, As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate."
