          "context": "want Pharaoh's strength? Do you understand? But this is what they're doing. It says at the end of verse number 2, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt. The world. Trust in the Lord. Right? Proverbs 3 verse number 5 and 6. With all thine heart and lean not. You know the verses, right? And we find here this evening that they are going to seek to be strengthened by the strength of Pharaoh who is inferior to God Almighty and God had made it abundantly clear and demonstrated that truth. And then they're going to trust in the shadow of Egypt. That's a sad commentary, is it not? I mean, what a sad, sad indictment against the children of Israel here. And we find that we are to abide. You don't need to turn there, but I'm mindful this evening of the truth of Psalm 91. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. Not the shadow of Pharaoh of Egypt, but of the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress. My God, in Him will I trust. Wow. If we know the Lord, why are we going to run to Egypt? Look at Isaiah 31. We see the indictment in Isaiah 30, but we see it continue in chapter 31. Woe to them, verse number 1, that go down to Egypt for help"
