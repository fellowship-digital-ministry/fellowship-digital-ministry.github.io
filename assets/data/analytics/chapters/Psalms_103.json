But God, I pray that you would just protect us and give your angels charge over us. Father, we thank you for the gathering of your people tonight. Bless our time together. We'll thank you now for it in Jesus' precious and holy and wonderful name. And this I do say, amen and amen. Thank you, may be seated. Turn with me if you will please to Psalm 103. Psalm 103. Psalm 103. Another great passage of scripture. I love the Psalms. It's a Psalm of David. And of course, most of the Psalms were put to music. This was God's hymn book. And I mentioned to men yesterday that the Psalms were written by David or Asaph. And Psalm 90, as far as we know, is the only Psalm written by Moses. And of course, the theme there in the center of that Psalm is time. Now, beloved, let me say this tonight before I get moving here. You know, we ought to be found redeeming the time for the days of evil. You know, we're inveterate time wasters, we Americans. We waste a lot of time. We waste a lot of time on things that really don't matter. I don't know what it was, but when I turned 55 many years ago now, I told the Lord, I said, Lord, listen,"

But Psalm 103, I'm gonna begin in verse one, read down through this, make some comments about it, then we're gonna move around just a little bit in the word of God tonight. But in Psalm 103 is inspired by the Holy Spirit. David writes this, he said, bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits. Amen. Don't you think that our God's a beneficent God? You know, when I was in the military, we're all talking about benefits. And we call it, we said, I'm gonna get my bennies. That's what we call it, bennies. I'm gonna get my bennies, amen. We're gonna do our 20 years or 30 years, whatever it is, gonna retire and get our benefits. And we always are talking about benefits. Let me tell you what, there's no greater benefit than what comes at the hand of God. And by the way, he's not just talking about material things here. Certainly we are blessed with material goodness. There's no two ways about that."
