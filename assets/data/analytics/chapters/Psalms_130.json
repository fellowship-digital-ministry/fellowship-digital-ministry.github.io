Look at these two verses here in Psalm 62. The Bible says, truly, my soul waiteth upon God. From him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defense. I shall not be greatly moved. Look at verse number five. My soul, wait thou only upon God. God, for my expectation is from Him. Are you expecting God to work? Anticipating God working? Looking forward to seeing God work? You say, I don't know how all this stuff is going to work out. God is able. Abraham, waiting on the Lord. God promised He was going to give me a son. It's not happened yet. How is it going to happen? Sarah, I'm old. It's beyond. Is anything too hard for the Lord? God did what He said He would do. Look at Psalm 130. Psalm 130, verse 5. I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait, and in His word do I hope. My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning. I say more than they that watch for the morning. Waiting on the Lord. Notice it says not only waiting on the Lord. Listen, when we think about waiting on the Lord, it's not that we're sitting idle"
