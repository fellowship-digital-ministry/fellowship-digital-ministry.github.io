          "context": "What affects you? How does it impact you? But we need to remember that we're dead with Christ. We're dead with Christ. Notice verse 11. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake. The life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us, but life in you. We, having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken. We also believe and therefore speak. He quotes back to the psalmist in Psalm 116. And I'm so thankful that we've been given truth, and then we speak the truth. We have been, listen, in 1 John, you read 1 John, chapter number one, John starts out talking about we're his witnesses. We're eyewitnesses of this. And we speak what we have received and what a blessing it is to know that God would use us. And we come to verse number 15. I'll get to verse 14 here in just a moment. But I want you to see verse number 15. For all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. Now I want you to think about verse 15. He speaks about all things are for your sakes. Paul was a man that was surrendered. He was yielded. He understood for me to live as Christ and to die as gain."
