We understand it with Simon Says, a little tiny game, but I'm talking now, let's look at the biblical truth of instruction. We can apply it as we will this evening, spiritual instruction, but in any arena in life, if someone is providing instruction, the expectation of the instructor is that that instruction is going to be received and applied. Otherwise they feel like they're wasting their time. And we find that unfortunately far too often biblical instruction has been rejected instead of being received. We find that it's been ignored instead of being implemented. Listen to these verses, if you will, with me, and I'll read two verses from the Old Testament. We're not gonna turn there, but listen, in Psalm 81, in verse number 11, the psalmist says this, God, of course, is giving the indictment against the nation of Israel. He says, but my people, listen to this, would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me. Listen, it wasn't that God didn't give the instruction. It wasn't even that they didn't know the instruction. It was that they would not hearken to my voice. In 2 Chronicles 24, in verse 19, the Bible says this, yet he sent prophets, plural, to them. Now I like, listen, every word of God is pure."
