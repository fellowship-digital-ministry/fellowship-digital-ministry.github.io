          "context": "once again recognize the authority of God's word and its influence on how we cast a ballot. We have the privilege of casting a ballot and I'm thankful for that. But I rejoice this morning to know that my King, my King Jesus, that he rules and that he reigns. Notice with me, we mentioned Psalm 10, 16 already, but notice if you will, in Psalm 29, in verse number 10, the Bible says this, the Lord sitteth upon the flood, yea, the Lord sitteth King forever. We find in Psalm 97 and verse number one, the Bible says this, the Lord reigneth. Aren't you thankful? The book of Revelation says, the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Our God reigns. And I'm so thankful this morning that we understand that and we can rejoice in that truth, but we must acknowledge that long ago, mankind rejected God as their ruler. We understand as you were to study the Old Testament and study the people of Israel, that they had a theocracy where literally God was their King. God was their ruler. And we find that they rejected God and they said this, give us a King. Samuel was disappointed with their interest in having a King. They desired to be like all the other people. They were so distinct and so unique that God was their King. They had a theocracy, but yet they wanted what the other nations of the world had. We find that Samuel was disappointed,"
