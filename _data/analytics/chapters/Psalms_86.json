So think about the nature of God and understand this evening that he loves us with an everlasting love. We find that Romans in chapter 8 teaches us that there's nothing that can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus, and how we can rejoice in that truth this evening. But when we understand tonight that God is love, we say that God loves me so much that he wants to protect me, that he wants to protect you. It's not a permissive, yeah, just go do whatever you want to do and live however you want to live because God is going to accept you because God is love. No, it's protective, not permissive. We find that our God is holy, he's righteous, he's faithful, he's love. Notice with me that our God is compassionate. Our God is compassionate. Look over in Psalm 86, if you will, Psalm 86 and verse number 15. In fact, if you want to jot down the entirety of Psalm 86, it'd be a great chapter for you to go and read and just to understand just the way in which David is praying and seeking the face of God, many of God's attributes."

A heart attitude of humility is displayed on the part of David to be taught the way of the Lord. We find in Psalm 86 and verse number 15, the Bible says this, but thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth. We see a number of other attributes in this verse of Scripture that are given beyond the fact that our God is compassionate, but I want you to take note of the fact that the Bible says that our God, that He is a God that is full of compassion. The word compassion is an interesting word. They tell us it's a mixed passion. It's a compound of love and sorrow. We think about the Word of God and how God's Word reveals to us that our God is compassionate, that He is full of compassion, and we rejoice in that truth, but we find that on many occasions, especially if you study the life of Christ and the Gospel records, you will find that there is"

          "context": "them in connection one with the other, and really there's just a small nuance and difference between the two attributes. If we say that grace is God giving us what we do not deserve, we would say this of mercy, that mercy is God not giving us what we deserve. And really, they're, again, very closely associated one with the other. The psalmist declares you were in Psalm 114 and Psalm 116. And verse number 5, I want you to notice, and we've already read a couple of verses that have referenced the mercy of God, but I want you to notice here again the grace and righteousness and mercy of our God is mentioned all in one verse of Scripture. Here in Psalm 116 and verse number 5, the Bible says, Gracious is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful. We find that over in the verse that we read a moment ago in Psalm 86 and verse number 5, that the psalmist tells us that our God is plenteous in mercy. We find that this phrase is found 41 times in the Scriptures. The phrase is this, that His mercy endureth forever. You read about that throughout the Psalms. And again, on 41 different times in the Scriptures, you read with regard to the mercy of God that His mercy endureth forever. Paul says, speaking of the mercy of God in Ephesians 2 and verse number 4,"

I hope the songs that we sing are offering, rendering praise unto our God, reminding us of who he is, reminding us of what he's done. It's a psalm of praise. In Psalm 86, turn over several pages here and look at Psalm 86 and, again, a psalm that's ascribed to David, and we find that here in this particular psalm, he's rejoicing. Really, it's a prayer of David. He's rejoicing for how the Lord would answer his prayer and teaching him his way. He says this in verse number 12, I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy name forevermore. In Psalm 118, again, this psalm begins with that same phraseology that we mentioned from Psalm 107, O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, because his mercy endureth forever.
