          "context": "word to be given to those who do not have it readily available. Why is it that Beacon of Truth is printing Bibles and engaged in the work? Why is it that we give to a ministry to print portions of scripture from tracts and John and Romans, Romans booklets, New Testaments, full Bibles? Why? Because we know the power of God's word, we love God's word, and we want other people to have it. So we labor, we work, we give of our resources so that the word can be published, so that the word can be proclaimed and be distributed around the world. But we come this evening to the personal nature of what the psalmist says, oh, how love I thy law. There's many reasons that we should love God's word. We looked at one there in Psalm 140, in Psalm 119, verse 140, where he says that thy word is very pure. We understand this book is a perfect book. This book is God's book, it's perfect. The source, all scripture. How much scripture? All scripture is given by inspiration of God. What a joy to know the book that we hold in our hands, that this book is pure, that this book is the very word of God. It's inspired by God. We find that the psalmist said, as we looked in Psalm 12, but in Psalm 19, in verse number seven, the psalmist makes this declaration with regard to God's word."
