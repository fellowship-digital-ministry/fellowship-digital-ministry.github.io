I'm just a passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. That's what the songwriter said. And we need to start living like that. But the reality is that if we take the perspective that God is in control, only if my candidate wins, you are not understanding the truth of the Bible. You cannot say, because my candidate wins, that God is in control. And then if your candidate loses, you say, well, God must not be in control. They did this, they did\u2026 No, no, no, no, no.

Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them. Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. Can I tell you that really, if you study the church history, there has never been a nation like our nation that has had as much liberty and freedom for a church as we have experienced. And you know what's happening? We're doing less for God today than we ever have. There literally, last week, Brother Hummel stood in this pulpit and said, America is now in the place where we need missionaries to come to her. Where we used to be the number one sending mission field of the, or mission sender of the entire world. And guess what? England was that at one point.
