And you might say this morning, Pastor, you have no idea, I'm in the midst of a trial right now, and I understand, a preacher of yesteryear said you're either in the midst of one, you've just come out of one, or there's one on the horizon, and for many we can say that's pretty true with regard to trials in our lives. We may not always respond properly in the midst of a trial. I'm sure that if you were to evaluate your life, if I were to evaluate my life, there are times in the midst of a trial that we do not respond appropriately, we do not respond biblically. We find, however, that God has given us in His Word the instruction that we are to rejoice always, not just to rejoice when things go well, when things are the way that we desire for them to be, but we find that we've been given that instruction, rejoice in the Lord always, Philippians 4 and verse number 4, and again I say unto thee, rejoice. The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath"

The psalmist said it this way in Psalm 118 and verse 24, this is the day the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it. And it's a determination, it's being purposed in the fact that we're going to rejoice no matter what comes our way in that particular day, we're going to rejoice in the Lord. And we have to be intentional about it, we have to be purposed in it, and we find that God will bless. Not only have we been given instruction with regard to rejoicing through trials, but we find that as we study through the pages of this precious book that we can read the record that God has given us of many who have rejoiced in the midst of great trials. Their behavior in the midst of trials was appropriate and I would say was exemplary as we have the opportunity to be able to study those portions of Scripture. I know in my life that I will face more trials. The reality this morning is that I know in your life that you will face more trials. We will face trials collectively, corporately as a church, and we understand that we will face trials. The question really this morning is not, will I face a trial?"

We will face trials collectively, corporately as a church, and we understand that we will face trials. The question really this morning is not, will I face a trial? The question this morning is this, how will I behave in the midst of the trial? Maybe I'll turn it this way to go along with the title this morning, will I rejoice through trials? Will I rejoice through trials? And I told you to look at 1 Peter and I would get there in a moment, but I want to read three portions of Scripture very quickly this morning. The first one is from the book of Habakkuk, and I want to read Habakkuk chapter number three. And as we look in Habakkuk chapter number three and look at what the prophet of old says with regard to rejoicing, again we'll look at two other examples in the New Testament as we get into the message this morning, and understanding that we've been given that command that we are to rejoice in the Lord always. Again, as we mentioned, the psalmist made that great declaration in Psalm 118. We sing the song, but it says, this is the day which the Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be glad in it. And we find here that Habakkuk, if you found your place there in Habakkuk chapter number"

And we find here that Habakkuk, if you found your place there in Habakkuk chapter number three, notice in verse 17, notice what the Bible says, although the fig tree shall not blossom. That's not a good situation. The fig tree is supposed to blossom, amen, produce fruit. Neither shall fruit be in the vines. That's unfortunate. The labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat. The flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. If you read Habakkuk 3 in verse 17, that paints a very, very dim picture. Would you agree? The Bible says that the fig tree shall not blossom, the fruit shall not be on the vines, the labor of the olive shall fail, the field shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. And yet the writer says, yet I will rejoice in the Lord. Habakkuk, did you see what you just wrote in verse 17? Yeah. That's why I said it's purposed, it's intentional. It's a, I'm going to rejoice in the Lord always. I'm going to determine, even in the midst, going through the trials of life, I'm going"
