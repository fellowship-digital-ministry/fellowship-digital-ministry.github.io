          "context": "Why? Why is it so important that this book not depart out of my mouth? Why is it so necessary that I meditate in it day and night? Because it's God's Word. Because it's God's Word. Then shalt thou find good success, have thy way prosperous and find good success. Think about the truth of Psalm 1. He shall be like a tree that's planted by the river. Who is it? The one that meditates on the Word day and night because they understand what it is. This morning, we thank the Lord for giving us the Bible. What a blessing. This book, someone said this, this book is the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the doom of sinners, the happiness of believers. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are binding, its histories are true, its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, practice it to be holy. This morning, I believe that inspiration reveals the greatness of God. God used, we talked about the process, 40 men, over 1500 years, 3 languages, 3 continents to give us one complete pure book. It's precious and it reveals to us how great God is that He could do that. The one that transcends time, the one that's outside of time was able to do that because all scripture is given by inspiration of God. This morning, I hope that we have a newfound appreciation for the Bible."
