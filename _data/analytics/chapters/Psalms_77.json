Isn't it amazing, as you read the account in Numbers chapter 14, our text for this morning, that when we deal with this truth, as we look through this passage of scripture, we notice first what Moses recalled, Moses recalled exactly what God had previously revealed to him. And I think about Moses making this recollection as mine, and I think about what the prophet says, the prophet Jeremiah, you don't need to turn there, but in the book of Lamentations, the third chapter, a very familiar passage of scripture for us, but we find that the third chapter of the book of Lamentations in verse number 21, here's what the writer says, this I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. Where new every morning, great is thy faithfulness. Jeremiah, after the Babylonian captivity, as he's lamenting all that's taken place, he says, this I recall, therefore have I hope. What? It is of the Lord's mercies. The Lord's mercies. Notice what the psalmist says, notice in Psalm 77, if you would turn there, Psalm 77, and notice what the Bible says in these few verses of scripture."

We won't read the entirety of the Psalm, but we find that in the first verse of Psalm 77, that the psalmist reveals that he's trying out to the Lord. He's in a day of trouble, according to verse number two, and he says, I've sought the Lord, but we'll pick it up in verse number six, the Bible says this, I call to remembrance my song in the night. I commune with mine own heart, my spirit made diligent search. Notice what he asks, these questions, will the Lord cast off forever? And will He be favorable no more? Is His mercy clean gone forever? Doth His promise fail forevermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up His tender mercies? Selah. Listen, there are times you might feel this way. You know what's different about us and the psalmist, and we understand some of the inspirational Holy Spirit of God, but for far too many of us, we fail in this area of transparency. And even being transparent with the Lord, there are times in which we deal with difficulties in our lives."

          "context": "John 13 is where we started last Sunday morning, that He loved them unto the end. We talked much about that cycle that I talked about last Sunday morning with regard to reminding ourselves that God loves us, and then resting in His love, and then rejoicing for His love. I'm so thankful that as we go through that process. that I said that we need to remind ourselves of God's love for us. Why? Because there are times in which the accuser, the brethren, would like to whisper to you and whisper to me that God has forgotten us and God's not loving us and God's mercies are dried up, as the psalmist says here in Psalm 77. But no, we remind ourselves that no, God does love me. No, God is merciful. And we find that here in this passage of scripture in Numbers 14 that Moses has recalled what God has previously revealed. It's so important for us to be students of God's word. You cannot recall what you do not know. You just can't. We understand we speak about God's word and we talk about revelation, all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and we understand that God was speaking through His men. Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. But you understand that the canon of scripture is closed. God's given us this book and He's told us to be students of this book."
