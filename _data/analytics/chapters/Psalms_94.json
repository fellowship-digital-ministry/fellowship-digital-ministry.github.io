No, God loves us and he's going to chasten. He's going to rebuke. I made this comment not long ago, and the reality is that when God is going to work in our lives and he's bringing some level in our lives using his word to convict us, that conviction is good. It's good for us. Notice with me in Proverbs chapter 3, if you will, we'll look at just a few verses where this progressive truth is given to us through the Bible. In Proverbs chapter 3, and when you think of that chapter, no doubt your mind races to verses 5 and 6. But I want to remind you that in Proverbs chapter 3, verses 11 and 12, notice what God tells us. Proverbs 3 and verse 11, Notice Psalm 94, if you will. Psalm 94 and verse number 12, we know that the psalmist says it this way, dealing with the truth of the chastening of the Lord. I'll read verse 11 along with it. Psalm 94, verse 11 and verse number 12. The Bible says this in verse 11. The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity."

Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law, that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked. Think about this. It says, blessed is the man whom thou chastenest. We ought to start thanking God for the chastening of God, the correction of God. He says here to the church of the Laodiceans that who he loves, he rebukes and he chastens. Look in Hebrews chapter 12, if you will. And it's a familiar passage of scripture here. In fact, a number of years ago when we had as our theme counter blessings and throughout that calendar year, I preached messages on reasons to rejoice. And we had all sorts of reasons to rejoice. It was a very topical type of a study throughout that calendar year. And near the end of the year, I said that we ought to learn to rejoice for the chastening of God. And I preached from this passage of scripture in Hebrews chapter 12. In verse number four, the Bible says this,"
