      "text": "set before him, he endured the cross. This word affliction in verse number 17 of our text of Scripture, the word troubled in verse number eight is the root word for that word affliction. We're troubled on every side, we're dealing with these afflictions. This morning again in Sunday school, Mark went over to Psalm 119, the psalmist says, it was good for me to be afflicted. Now, most of us would never say that. Why, we don't like being afflicted. Are we honest this morning? You don't like affliction? But the psalmist says it was good for me to be afflicted, why, because then I learned thy statutes. There's some things that we learn about God. There's some things that we learn about God's grace and about God's power, about God's purpose through the times of affliction, through the times of difficulty. And Paul says, it's just light affliction, it's just for a moment. Then notice what he says, because he understands that God is working to accomplish something great. He's working to accomplish something that would bring glory to his name. Notice in verse number 17, he says, for our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Paul, beaten, stoned, shipwrecked. Oh, God's working. He's working something good. He's working something great. He's working something for his glory. He's helping me to be conformed to his image. It's wonderful, but it's all based on perspective.",

In Psalm 12, in verse number six, the Bible says, \"'The words of the Lord are pure words. As silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord. Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever.'\" And as you recall, this morning, as we looked at the person of Jesus Christ, being thankful for his person, who he is, the very first thing that we mentioned is he is Alpha and Omega, he's eternal. And here we find that he's promised that he would preserve his words, these words that are pure words, he's gonna preserve them from this generation forever. And to be mindful of the fact this evening that the eternal God has given us a promise to preserve the precious Word of God ought to cause us to rejoice because I can have full confidence in faith in what the Word of God says. Why? Because God said he was going to preserve it. And since God said he was gonna preserve it because God is trustworthy and dependable and always does what he says he will do, we can rest assured that God has indeed preserved his Word. Notice, if you will, in Psalm 119 in verse number 89, the Bible tells us, of course,",

Notice, if you will, in Psalm 119 in verse number 89, the Bible tells us, of course, you're familiar with this chapter in Psalm 119 dealing with the Word of God and all the wonderful characteristics and the ways in which the psalmist is relating to the Word of God and its place in his life. And here in Psalm 119 in verse 89, the Bible says, forever, O Lord, thy Word is settled in heaven. Forever. His Word is settled in heaven. Jesus said this in Matthew 24 in verse number 35 as he's speaking here and giving instruction, he gives note with regard to the Word of God and he says, heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. There are people that are trying to revise the Bible. They're trying to remove the Bible, right? We live in a society in which they're trying to revise it, they're trying to remove it, but we find that God has promised that he's going to preserve it. And it doesn't matter, as we mentioned this morning, our God is victorious. It doesn't matter of the scheme and plan of the evil one and the wicked one to try to rid our society of this book.",
