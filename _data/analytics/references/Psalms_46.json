      "text": "hope for you as well because we need God's grace. His grace is amazing. We sing the song. I know every time we get near the 180s that Brother Don says, why can't it be 187, right? Sing Amazing Grace and it's such a wonderful song and a wonderful truth. God's grace is abundant but he said that his grace is sufficient for me and he said that his grace is sufficient for you. I preached the very first message this year that it's a promise that is explained but it's a promise that must be embraced and how important it is that we go through life understanding the joy it is to experience the grace of God as Paul fulfilled the will of God in his life, I would say this, he had hardships. He had hardships. In fact, Job chapter 14 speaks of the man that's born of woman is a few days and full of trouble. He had hardships but I want you to understand this morning that Paul had hardships but he had God's help. I'm so thankful that Hebrews chapter 13 in verse number six reminds us that we can have that confidence that God, he is our helper. I'm thankful for Psalm 46 and in fact, if you study the entirety of Psalm 46, it's amazing what the Psalmist says but he speaks about in verse number one how God is a very present help in the time of trouble",

I'm thankful for Psalm 46 and in fact, if you study the entirety of Psalm 46, it's amazing what the Psalmist says but he speaks about in verse number one how God is a very present help in the time of trouble and you find that as the verses continue in Psalm 46 in verse two and three, the catastrophic events that the Psalmist references in that Psalm but yet he says, my God is a very present help in the time of trouble. Paul dealt with hardships but Paul experienced God's help and what a blessing that is as we look at the passage of scripture, look at it in verse number eight, begin reading with me. The Bible says this, we are troubled on every side yet not distressed, we are perplexed but not in despair, persecuted but not forsaken, cast down but not destroyed. Always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. So then death worketh in us but life in you, we having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken, we also believe and therefore speak, knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus",

      "text": "And so we find that Jehoshaphat, with facing this dilemma, with dealing with this difficulty, his knowledge of who God is, but also his knowledge of what God has said, that God wants to be your helper. Listen, we understand the psalmist has declared this throughout the Psalms, and we've studied many of them as we've had the opportunity to speak about the truth that our God is our helper, and we think about this truth, you don't need to turn there, but in Psalm 46 and verse number 1, the psalmist declares God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. He's not only able to help, he's available to help. Have you ever known somebody that's able to help, but they just don't have any availability? You need help with a project, and you know so-and-so can help you, because they have the know-how, but they're just simply not available. They're busy, they have other appointments, they have other tasks that they're working on. That never happens with God. He's a very present help in the time of trouble. It's interesting what the psalmist continues to say in Psalm 46 and verses 2 and 3. He says, therefore, based upon our understanding that God is our refuge and our strength and a very present help in trouble, will not we fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea, though the waters thereof roar",
