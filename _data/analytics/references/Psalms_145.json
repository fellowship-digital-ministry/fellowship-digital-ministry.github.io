      "text": "this year with this theme that I made note that the psalmist made two powerful statements really with regard to the greatness of God as it relates to our theme for this year. And one of those is in Psalm 135, in verse number five, where the psalmist said this, for I know that the Lord is great, that our Lord is above all gods. Each and every individual, every child of God needs to know and be fully persuaded in their own heart and mind that God is great. And we ought to be able to say with the psalmist, for I know that the Lord is great. God wants us to know his greatness. He has given us his precious word. He's revealed to us his character, his nature, and he helps us to understand how great he is. But then in Psalm 145, in verse number six, the psalmist makes that second statement that is so impactful with regard to our theme for this year. And at the end of that verse of scripture, the psalmist says this, and I will declare thy greatness. I will declare thy greatness. Near the end of the year, we'll get into phase three of our series for this particular annual theme. And phase one, discover God's greatness. Phase two, declare God's greatness. And then we're gonna deal with a number of messages, just a handful of messages on this thought of living",
