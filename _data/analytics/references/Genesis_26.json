      "text": "his birthright unto Jacob I Mentioned that it seems evident as you look at the passage of Scripture that this Trading or selling of a birthright was something that could be done I'm not sure at how often it was practiced or how popular the practice was but no doubt There's an agreement that is made the the inquiry sell me this day thy birthright and Jacob then says To Esau after Esau says what profit does this birthright have to me Jacob says I want you to swear to it Swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob and then the Bible says then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his birthright the significance of this account that is given to us again with not a ton of detail that's provided is Seen in upcoming passages of Scripture that we'll study and we understand the significance of this Particular event and as we look at this in future lessons and messages, we'll be able to reference back but we find that the Bible says that that Jacob then gives Esau this food and he ate and he drank and Then he rose up and went his way Despised his birthright notice keep your hand here in Genesis 26",
