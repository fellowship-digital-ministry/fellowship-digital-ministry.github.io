      "text": "to move forward, we we see the warning of the hindrances of sin in our fellowship, but we then see the blessedness of abiding in Him and we're reminded of the protection of God. I'm so thankful that the Bible tells us here in verse number 18, we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not. Now I'll break that down in just a moment, but I want to focus on the beginning part when it says we know that whosoever is born of God. And I think about that phrase because in, and he started the fifth chapter of the book of 1st John, he used that phrase born of God twice. In verse number one of 1st John 5, he said whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And then in verse number four, he says whosoever is born of God overcometh the world. I dealt with this several weeks ago. What does it mean to be born of God? It means that I recognize that I'm a sinner and that Christ is the only Savior. And I receive Him as my personal Savior, understand that He died for me, that He was buried, and then He rose again conquering sin, death, and the grave. It's just as Jesus said to Nicodemus, marvel not that I say unto you, unto thee, ye must be born again. Nicodemus was the one that came",
