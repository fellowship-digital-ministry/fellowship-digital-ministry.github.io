      "text": "to chapter number six, if you will, and we see some things in chapters four and five, but in chapter number six, we begin to see about the seal judgments. And I just want to focus for just a few minutes this morning on the first of these three seal judgments that are mentioned in Revelation chapter number six, because this is the rise of Antichrist, the first seal in particular. Notice in Revelation six, in verses one and two, the Bible says this is the first of these seven seals. It says, and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals. Now, who's the lamb? That's Jesus, right? That is the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. So the lamb opens one of the seals, and I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, come and see. And I saw, and behold, a white horse. And he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Let me say this, this is none other than the counterfeit, the Antichrist. This is not the Lord Jesus Christ. We find that he will come in Revelation chapter 19, and we read of that passage of Scripture, and the heaven is open in verse number 11 of Revelation 19.",

I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. That's the return of Jesus Christ at the end of the tribulation. This record of this first seal in Revelation 6, verses 1 and 2, this white horse, this is the counterfeit, this is the rise of Antichrist, which happens after the rapture of the church. Now look at the second seal. In verses 3 and 4, the Bible says, and when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see. And there went out another horse that was red, and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. And there was given unto him, notice this says, a great sword. Now I believe that as you read through the book of Revelation, and you read of the seal judgments, and you read of the trumpet judgments, and you read of the vial or the bowl judgments, that they happen in rapid succession.",

      "text": "that Enoch walked with God and was not, for God took him. What a great testimony that Enoch had. And the Bible says that he was prophesying, and what he's prophesying is that the Lord comes with ten thousand of his saints. He's speaking about the second coming of Christ. Many today in our society, listen, they don't even have any awareness of this truth of the second coming of Christ. He came as a lamb to die the first time, but he's coming as the lion of the tribe of Judah. The Bible says, look at what it says in verse 15, why is he coming with ten thousands of his saints? To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they have ungodly committed, and of all their harsh speeches, which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. He's getting right after it, isn't he? He's going to execute judgment. We understand this is at a future time. Revelation 19 explains for us, gives us the picture of this second coming of Christ when he comes at the end of the tribulation period. The Bible says in verse number 11 of Revelation 19, And I saw heaven open, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true. And in righteousness he doth judge and make war. The righteous Lord loveth righteousness. Righteousness exalteth a nation.",

And in righteousness he doth judge and make war. The righteous Lord loveth righteousness. Righteousness exalteth a nation. Sin is a reproach to any people. The Bible says that in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God. The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.\" Listen, he's coming back and he is going to execute righteous judgment.

      "text": "period recorded and revealed in those next several chapters throughout the book of Revelation and all of the judgments that are poured out. You come to chapter 19 and there's a reference that we're going to deal with with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb and then you look at the advent of Christ, that he comes back not as the Lamb of God but as the Lion of the tribe of Judah and he comes back and we come with them and of course we understand that he's going to establish his millennial reign and what a joy that is, but I want you to focus just for a moment this morning on this truth with regard to the marriage supper of the Lamb. In verse number seven, now you understand biblically speaking that God refers to himself as the Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the Bride. We just looked at that just a moment ago in Ephesians 5 and we see that that example, that relationship is referenced many times throughout the scriptures and now we come to Revelation 19 in verse number 7 and the Bible says, let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come. It's going to happen one day, we don't know when it's going to happen but we know it's going to happen, but I want you to notice",

      "text": "He is, He is Alpha and Omega. Notice in verse number eight, Jesus says, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. We find that our God has no beginning and no ending. We find that the Bible tells us of the life of Christ and the life of John the Baptist, that John the Baptist testifies that He was before me. But earthly speaking, from a human perspective, Jesus Christ was born physically after John the Baptist. Why was it that John the Baptist would say, He is before me, and He is preferred above me? Why? Because of the eternality of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is Alpha and Omega. He's the beginning and the end. He is, He was, and He is to come. And we ought to rejoice in who He is. We find that also here in this verse of Scripture, it says that He is Almighty. Notice the very last phrase there. The Almighty. You think about the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, the Bible tells us in Revelation 19 in verse 6, He is Almighty. And when you begin to think about who He is, and you begin to rejoice and be thankful in who He is, and we are mindful this morning that He has no beginning and no ending, that He is Almighty, that there's nothing, there's nothing, no situation, no circumstance,",

      "text": "There's war in the book of Joshua. There's not gonna be war or death in heaven, amen? So it's not a picture of heaven. It's a picture, however, of the victorious Christian life. And oh, how we can have victory because He is victorious. He is faithful. He is faithful. Faithful is He that calleth you who also will do it is what Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 5 and verse 24. But I wanna draw your attention to what the Bible says in Revelation 19. In Revelation 19, this portion of scripture gives us a glimpse as to the second coming of Christ at the end of the tribulation period, not when He just comes in the air at the rapture to take the church with Him, but at the end of the tribulation period when He comes all the way back to the earth and He's going to establish His millennial kingdom. We find that the Bible tells us in verse number 11, and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and He that sat upon Him was called Faithful and True. And in righteousness He doth judge and make war. His eyes was a flame of fire and on His head were many crowns and He had a name written that no man knew but He Himself.
