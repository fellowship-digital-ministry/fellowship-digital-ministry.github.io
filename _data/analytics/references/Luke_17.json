This is right after the Lord Jesus Christ deals with church discipline in verses 15-20. In verse 21, then came Peter to Him and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Till seven times Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven. Notice in Luke chapter 17. Notice what the Bible says in Luke 17. This is a passage of Scripture that we use. is really several years ago, verse number five. And as I preached on this, increase our faith, we dealt with it in the very first Sunday of that particular calendar year of looking at the context of this whole passage and where they say increase our faith. But notice in verse number one of Luke 17, then said he, this is Jesus speaking to the disciples, it is impossible, but the defenses will come. But woe unto him through whom they come, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast him to the sea, then that he should offend one of these little ones. Then he says this, take heed to yourselves. If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him, and if you repent, forgive him. Verse number three, the teaching of Jesus",
