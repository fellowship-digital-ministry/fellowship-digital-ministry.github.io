      "text": "he is coming, but he's coming at a set time. No man knows the hour. We don't know when he's coming, but we know that he's coming, and I know that certainly for us, man, it'd be okay if he came right now, but if he doesn't come right now, it means that he still has a task for us to do right now as we continue to wait upon him, knowing that his timing is perfect. Think about these verses. Turn to the book of Psalms, if you will, Psalm 27. Read about four verses or so from the book of Psalms, and then we'll look at two other passages of scripture, and then wrap it up this evening. Psalm 27, let's read these fairly quickly, and we'll get over to our fellowship this evening. Psalm 27, in verse number 14, notice what the word of God says. Wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord, chapter 33 and verse number 20. Notice this. Our soul waiteth for the Lord. He is our help and our shield. Aren't you thankful the Lord is our helper? He's our helper. He's our shield. He protects us. Look at Psalm 62, if you will. Verses one and also verse number five. Look at these two verses here in Psalm 62. The Bible says, truly, my soul waiteth upon God. From him cometh my salvation.",
