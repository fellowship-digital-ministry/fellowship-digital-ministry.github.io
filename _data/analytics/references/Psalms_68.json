It's not just a, I have to say this because duty demands it, so to speak. I have to say this because somebody's looking for a testimony. We have praise and thanksgiving type of service. In fact, during our Thanksgiving season, we have a prayer, praise, and pie service. We ask people to share testimonies. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Praise the Lord. It ought not to be a difficult thing. In fact, it ought to be when we take testimonies that we run out of time, amen, because there's so much to praise them for, truly. We sing the song, count your blessings, name them one by one. Dean, often as he sings that song or leads that song, he gets sidetracked and he doesn't continue leading in the time because he's going like this, right? Count your blessings. You've seen him, I've seen him do it, I know you've seen him do it. The reality is that the songwriter, through that song, is trying to remind us of the truth of Psalm 68, that he, God, hath daily loatheth us with benefits. There's so much to praise him for, and we need to resolve to praise the Lord. Psalm 69, notice what is said here by the psalmist in Psalm 69, in verse number 30.",

Psalm 69, notice what is said here by the psalmist in Psalm 69, in verse number 30. In Psalm 69, in verse number 30, the psalmist says, I will praise the name of God with a psalm and will magnify him with thanksgiving. Does our song praise God? I hope it does. I hope the songs that we sing are offering, rendering praise unto our God, reminding us of who he is, reminding us of what he's done. It's a psalm of praise. In Psalm 86, turn over several pages here and look at Psalm 86 and, again, a psalm that's ascribed to David, and we find that here in this particular psalm, he's rejoicing. Really, it's a prayer of David. He's rejoicing for how the Lord would answer his prayer and teaching him his way. He says this in verse number 12, I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy name forevermore. In Psalm 118, again, this psalm begins with that same phraseology that we mentioned from Psalm 107, O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, because his mercy endureth forever. But here in Psalm 118, in verse number 21, the Bible says this, I will praise thee, notice this, for thou",

      "text": "Why do they give? Because God's given to us. And so we find here that Jacob recognizes the blessing of God, he gives God the glory, but then he and himself, he wants to be a blessing. He says, take I pray thee. Notice the wording of verse number 11. Take I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee. God blessed me, and now I can be a blessing to someone else. We sing the song channels only. Being a channel, a conduit of God's blessing. As God pours out the blessing, it's not so that we can just gather as much as we can gather and try to build bigger barns and so on and so forth, but God's blessed us so that we can be a blessing. I mean, this is great truth in the life of Jacob. We find this evening that I believe each and every one of us we'd be honest, God hath dealt graciously with me. God's been so good to us. Psalm 68 and verse number 19, read just a few verses of scripture. As we make some application in our own lives, listen, God's been good to us. So, so good. We're so undeserving. You know, there are times that we don't even thank Him like we should. He's still so good to us. It's amazing how good God is. Notice in Psalm 68, specifically look at verse number 19. The Bible says,",

Notice in Psalm 68, specifically look at verse number 19. The Bible says, blessed be the Lord who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah. You read that word Selah, of course we've mentioned this before, it's pause, meditate, think about this, chew on it. Let the truth sink in. But I want you to notice that middle phrase, if you will, of this verse of scripture, where the Bible says who daily loadeth us with benefits. I like the wording. I like how God gives us this picture of just how good He's been to us. He doesn't just give us a little bit of a blessing, He loads us with benefits. In my mind's eye, in my sanctified imagination, I see kind of a wheelbarrow, if you will, and you're trying to fill that thing up. And I mean, you just get it as full as you can because you want to make as few trips as possible and man, it's just over and you're trying to steer that thing. Have you ever been there? You ever done that before? And then all of a sudden you put too much in it and you tilt that thing over",
