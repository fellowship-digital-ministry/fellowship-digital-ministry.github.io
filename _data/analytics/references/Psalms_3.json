He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my high tower and my refuge, my Savior. Thou savest me from violence.\" The word shield and the word buckler in the Hebrew is the same exact word. They're synonymous one with the other. It's the same Hebrew word. We find that here, David recognizes this precious truth that the Lord is my shield. He is my buckler.

And I wonder this evening, how often do we go through life when we journey, when we deal with the things of life and all that life brings our way, how often do we enter each day understanding the Lord is my shield? He's my buckler. He is my protection. And Abram is given this greeting. Fear not, Abram. I am thy shield. Psalms. In the book of Psalms, we'll look at a number of verses. Psalm 3 to begin. And look at the third psalm if you will. And we'll look at the third verse of this particular psalm. Of course, it's the psalm of David. We use that passage in 2 Samuel 22.

I want to look at verse 1 along with it. In verse 1, it says this, \"...I will love Thee, O Lord, my strength. The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, my God, my strength, and whom I will trust, my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.\" Now, let me submit to you this evening that when you understand these things about who God is, we mentioned we started our series on Wednesday evening. We returned to the study of the book of Titus and we picked up with the sound doctrine aspect of what's being dealt with there in Titus 2 in verse 1. And we dealt with bibliology and on Wednesday evening, we started the section dealing with theology and understanding who God is. When you understand who He is, it really changes your life.
