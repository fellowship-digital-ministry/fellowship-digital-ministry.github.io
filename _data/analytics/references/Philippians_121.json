      "text": "but here's what Paul says of himself in Galatians 2, in verse number 20, I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Paul said, I'm crucified with Christ. You know what he's saying? He says it this way, I die daily, I'm dead with Christ. I'm dead, my old man is dead, I'm alive. Romans talks about being dead to the flesh, but alive unto God. And we find that Paul, as I referenced earlier, he says in Philippians 121, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. Second Timothy, if you'll remember, in chapter two, one of the early on truths that we shared with regard to a good soldier, a good soldier endures hardness. He says in verse number three, thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. And so how can we endure? Can we endure? Listen, we are challenged this morning to prepare for persecution. We see the experience of the Apostle Paul, but we understand what we should expect. You say, pastor, I don't want to face persecution. I understand, and I'm in the same category that you're in. I don't want to face it. But what I don't want to do is have my head in the sand",
