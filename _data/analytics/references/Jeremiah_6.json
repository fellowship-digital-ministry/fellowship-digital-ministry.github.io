And if I'm seeking to learn to be content, if I'm desiring to learn what Paul learned, what he references here in the book of Philippians, then I must be aware of what the enemy of contentment is. Listen, we live in a society that bombards us with advertisements, the marketing industry on telling you what you need and why you need it, right? Don't we?

I've never been able to operate without that. I mean, isn't that amazing? And that's what the marketing industry, that's what they do, that's why they exist. Look at Jeremiah 6 and verse 13.
