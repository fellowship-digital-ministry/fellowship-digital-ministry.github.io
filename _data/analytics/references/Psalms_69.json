A settled determination that in my life, that through my life, I am going to declare the greatness of God. I am going to magnify my God. As we think about this truth of a resolve to magnify the Lord, I see several examples in the scripture. The first is the resolve of the psalmist. Notice you're in Psalm 70, but look back in Psalm 69 in verse number 30. Notice what the psalmist says here. Again, another psalm that's attributed to David. It says in Psalm 69 in verse number 30, I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify Him with thanksgiving. I like the first two words, I will. That's resolve. That's determination. That's settled determination. That is a fixed purpose of mind. I will do this. What does the psalmist say he will do? I will praise the name of God with a song. Aren't you thankful that He is worthy of our praise? And we're to lift up our voice and sing praise unto the name of our God because He is worthy. And then the psalmist says, I will magnify Him with thanksgiving. You know, when you give thanks, you're magnifying God. Why? Because you're declaring His greatness. I'm thanking God for what He's done, for who He is, and for how He's worked.",

      "text": "whole heart I will show forth all thy marvelous works. Think about the wholehearted aspect that the psalmist shares with us here. It's not just a, I have to say this because duty demands it, so to speak. I have to say this because somebody's looking for a testimony. We have praise and thanksgiving type of service. In fact, during our Thanksgiving season, we have a prayer, praise, and pie service. We ask people to share testimonies. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Praise the Lord. It ought not to be a difficult thing. In fact, it ought to be when we take testimonies that we run out of time, amen, because there's so much to praise them for, truly. We sing the song, count your blessings, name them one by one. Dean, often as he sings that song or leads that song, he gets sidetracked and he doesn't continue leading in the time because he's going like this, right? Count your blessings. You've seen him, I've seen him do it, I know you've seen him do it. The reality is that the songwriter, through that song, is trying to remind us of the truth of Psalm 68, that he, God, hath daily loatheth us with benefits. There's so much to praise him for, and we need to resolve to praise the Lord. Psalm 69, notice what is said here by the psalmist in Psalm 69, in verse number 30.",

Psalm 69, notice what is said here by the psalmist in Psalm 69, in verse number 30. In Psalm 69, in verse number 30, the psalmist says, I will praise the name of God with a psalm and will magnify him with thanksgiving. Does our song praise God? I hope it does. I hope the songs that we sing are offering, rendering praise unto our God, reminding us of who he is, reminding us of what he's done. It's a psalm of praise. In Psalm 86, turn over several pages here and look at Psalm 86 and, again, a psalm that's ascribed to David, and we find that here in this particular psalm, he's rejoicing. Really, it's a prayer of David. He's rejoicing for how the Lord would answer his prayer and teaching him his way. He says this in verse number 12, I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy name forevermore. In Psalm 118, again, this psalm begins with that same phraseology that we mentioned from Psalm 107, O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good, because his mercy endureth forever. But here in Psalm 118, in verse number 21, the Bible says this, I will praise thee, notice this, for thou",
