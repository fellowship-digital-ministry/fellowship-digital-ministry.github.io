So if you were to look at a map of the inheritance of the nation of Israel when they entered the land, the southern part of Israel is where Judah is and within Judah, it's almost like a perfect circle, is Simeon. So they have a land that is within the land, if you will, of Judah, within the inheritance of Judah. We read of that in Joshua 19 and verse number 9. If you have Bible maps in your Bible and you look at some that are dated with regard to the inhabiting and the dividing of the land, you'll notice how that they are within that inheritance that was given to Judah. It's interesting when you consider Simeon, and we'll look at both of these individually though it seems as if they stand before Jacob together, by the time in the book of Numbers the second census is given, which is recorded for us in Numbers 26, verse number 14 with regard to the Simeonites specifically, you will know that by that time the size of the tribe of Simeon decreased by over 37,000 people. That's a lot of people. The tribe during the first census, they were counted at 59,300 and by the time of the second census they were down to 22,200. Wow. We see the decrease in Simeon.",
