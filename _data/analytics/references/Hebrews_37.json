      "text": "know how many times I Was gonna preach through the book of Hebrews this year and I'm working on it I'm working on it, but prior to preaching through the book of Hebrews I don't know how many times I read the book of Hebrews over my walk with God But I know that I purposefully read the book of Hebrews 37 times between October and December in preparation of the messages on the book of Hebrews Just in its entirety, just starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter 13. And the next day, starting in chapter number 1 and reading through chapter number 13. And then, as I preach and prepare the messages, you know how many times I read the passage that I'm going to preach? I can't number it for you. Why? I'm trying to get it. I want to understand it. I want to dig into the Word of God. There are passages of Scripture... Have you ever come across a passage and say, I'm not sure what that means? Come on, if you haven't, I need to talk to you. And maybe you need to come up here and preach. But there are times in which you come to a passage of Scripture and say, God, I don't know what you mean. I don't know what you're trying to tell me. I don't understand the truth that you're trying to reveal.",
