So verse 12 says teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. I want you to notice the end of verse number 9 where the Bible says that we spend our years as a tale that is told. For us this evening we have the privilege of reading the story of Joseph, the account that God has given us. The tale, if you look at this verse of Psalm 99, we spend our years as a tale that is told. We're reading Joseph's story, the account of his life. And I want you to understand that at this particular time in Joseph's life that there are some events that have taken place that could certainly lead to confusion. No doubt there are times in your lives, in my life, in your life, when things seem to take what we might call an unexpected turn. They're happen. You say, I didn't see this coming, I didn't know that was going to happen, I didn't think these people were going to treat me this way, or I didn't, an unexpected turn.

      "text": "that this, the dealing with the subject matter that is before us of this first attribute, the holiness of God, that our God is holy, it really is His most prominent attribute that we find in the Word of God, and we find that it means to be perfectly pure. We find that it means to be complete in moral character. You understand that our God is not becoming holy, He is holy, and He will ever be. We find that the psalmist declares in Psalm 99, in verse number 9, exalt the Lord our God and worship at His holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy. And this evening, we think about the holiness of God, and we begin to understand as we review the attributes of God, we begin to understand how He transcends us, and we begin to notice the way that He would interact with us. And this evening, we have to rejoice at the fact that we serve a God who is perfectly holy. In fact, the psalmist, on more than one occasion, gives this admonition to the reader that we are to give thanks at the remembrance of His holiness. When we're mindful that our God is holy, it ought to cause us to rejoice. We find that we sang, actually this past Sunday morning, we sang, Holy, Holy, Holy. And what a great song it is to just pause and just reflect in the holiness of our God.",
