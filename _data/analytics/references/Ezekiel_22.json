And as you search the scriptures, as you prove all things, as you determine, as you dig in, you find that God will help us to be able to determine what is evil, what is good.

And we're familiar with verse number 30 when the Bible says that God sought for a man, but he found none. But I want you to look specifically here in Ezekiel 22, and look at verse number 26 with me.
