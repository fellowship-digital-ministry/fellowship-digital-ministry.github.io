Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and Thou art exalted as head above all. Isn't that a powerful verse of Scripture? I mean, you ought to memorize that verse of Scripture. Seriously. You see what, as David is worshiping, as David is giving the offering and as they're worshiping here, he gives us under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God this great truth with regard to who our God is. Isaiah 25. Notice here in this portion of Scripture when we think about the victory of our Lord Jesus Christ and we think about Him conquering sin, death, and the grave. Isaiah 25 is prophetic, no doubt. As we look at the truth of Isaiah 25 in verse number 8 and we find that Paul will use this portion of Scripture at the end of 1 Corinthians 15, but here in Isaiah 25 in verse number 8, the Bible says He will swallow up death in what? In victory. The Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the earth for the Lord hath spoken it. Aren't those good words at the end of verse number 8? For the Lord hath spoken it. What He says, He does. Always.",
