      "text": "we go throughout the entirety of the book, you'll find that there are many references to walking and obeying the Lord Jesus Christ, and having that fellowship results in joy. Let's just be honest with one another this morning. When I'm not walking in fellowship with God, my joy suffers. I'm not as joyful when I'm not walking with God as I am when I am walking with God. And if you'd be honest and evaluate your life this morning, you'd say, yeah, I've experienced that. Notice in John 16, in verse number 24, hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name. Ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. You think about the prayer and prayer being answered. The Bible says, if I regard iniquity in Psalm 66 and verse 18 in my heart, the Lord will not hear me. It's not that He can't hear you. He can hear us, and so that sin hinders our fellowship with Him and hinders His answering to us. And here He says this, when you think about that praying, you know praying is a result of being in fellowship, right? Let me ask you, don't answer me, please don't answer me, but let me ask you to think about this personally in your life. If there's some hindrance between you and your spouse, and there's some contention between you, and your fellowship has been hindered, how's your communication? Not great, because your fellowship's been hindered, right?",
