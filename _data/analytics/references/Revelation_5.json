      "text": "45 could no longer refrain himself and he makes known his identity. Why? Because Judah was broken. He was repentant. We find that here in this text of Scripture, Judah in Genesis chapter 49, back in verses 8, down through verse number 12, we begin to read of this blessing and though there was fault in his life, there was sin in his life, it's not mentioned here and I believe it's because of that brokenness, but we see the blessing that's given Judah would be the royal tribe. He'd be the royal tribe. Kings. Not a blessing. But I think more than just kings that would rule over Israel, in our text of Scripture, there's no doubt that the Holy Spirit of God has given us this portion of Scripture and in view is the Lord Jesus Christ who remember in Revelation 5 in verse number 5 is known as the lion of the tribe of Judah. We know that in Hebrews 7 in verse number 14 when the Bible's speaking about the priesthood, it says that we know that Jesus, He didn't come from Levi. No, He came from Judah, from the tribe of Judah. And so we find that here, no doubt there's a view. I mentioned already the purpose, the process and the prophetic view. There's a view here. here in verses 8-12 that goes all the way through the Millennial Kingdom of Christ. All the way back in Genesis 49.",
