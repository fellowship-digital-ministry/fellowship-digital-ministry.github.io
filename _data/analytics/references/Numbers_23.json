The character of the promiser, the one who's making the promises, the character of that individual is what gives the promise its value. Now we mentioned here that Peter says in 2 Peter 1 and verse number 4, whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises. The thought continues and says, the promises of God are meant to ignite faith, expectation and desire, and then to point us to him. And you think about the way that the promises of God should ignite faith in us and expectation and should cause us to draw closer to him. His promises act to bind our hearts to his. The song says, every promise of the book is mine. And what a blessing to think about the many promises that are contained within the Word of God. Numbers 23 and verse number 19 tells us that God is not a man that he should lie. I'm so thankful that our God is faithful. He's trustworthy. He's dependable. He is truth. And he's given us many, many promises. And these promises are indeed exceeding great and precious. This evening I have a list of 15 promises that I want to give you. And the list is not exhaustive. You can go and you can find many, many promises within the Word of God.",
