      "text": "I mean, just think about that. Think of the weight of that statement, the magnitude of that statement where God says, hey, listen, I, God, God, delight and mercy. That's what he says. I think it was a missionary who wrote this down, he said, mark those words, he delighteth in mercy, and you will not find a single verse anywhere in the book that says he delighteth in wrath and judgment and punishment, not a verse anywhere in the whole book from cover to cover, from Genesis to Revelation, you won't find a single verse that teaches or says that God delights in judgment or punishment or wrath. But you can find many places which either stay plainly or clearly indicate, just as it does here in Micah 7, 18, that he delighteth in mercy. It is his joy to show mercy to fallen man. Can you imagine that? And I don't know about you, but I'll tell you something, when I think about it, it just absolutely and positively stultifies my brain. I just have to sit and wonder. I just have to consider this, muse upon this, meditate on it, think about it. Why would God want to show mercy to me? I know me, and I know who I was, and I know what I did. And I wonder sometimes, why, oh God, would you want to show mercy to me, an old wicked sinner?",
