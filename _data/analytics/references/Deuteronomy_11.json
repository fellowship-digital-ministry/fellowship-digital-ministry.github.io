When I know what God says, it enables me to boldly say, the Lord is my helper, I shall not fear what man shall do unto me. That was free tonight, amen? Deuteronomy chapter number 11, and we'll be looking here at the first 17 verses of Deuteronomy 11. Of course, last week, as you know, we started a mini-series that I entitled, The Danger of Deception. I am thoroughly convinced that we are currently living in an age of deception. I believe that as we look around our world, that it is not too difficult for any of us to recognize that we are living in an age of deception. In fact, as we study the Word of God, we find that our God has graciously warned us about the reality of deception. He told us that it was going to be the case. Not only did He warn us about the deception that we would face, but I am very thankful that He has given us the truth of His Word, He has provided us with the remedy for deception. What a blessing to know and to have the Word of God and to know the truth. What a blessing. We will recall that as we began our series last Wednesday evening, that I mentioned to",

It says in verse number 17, and then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you and He shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Focus our attention on verse number 16. It's interesting to me as we look at the context of Deuteronomy 11 and we understand the place of the warning. It's in the time of the blessing of God and a time in which God is doing what He said that He would do and He says, take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived. The heart we find as we look throughout the Word of God, God's Word says much to us about the heart and we can look at a number of passages. We will not have time this evening to do that, but we find the Bible talks about a hard heart, a proud heart, a pure heart, an understanding heart, just to mention a few. And there are many references to the heart. It's been defined as the seat of the affections and passions, the seat of the understanding, the seat of the will.

You'll be mindful that it was God in Genesis chapter number 6, you don't need to turn there, but He's speaking to Noah and talking about the judgment that would come with regard to the wickedness God saw in verse number 5 of Genesis 6, that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. We think about this warning in Deuteronomy 11 and really we couple it with what Jeremiah proclaims in Jeremiah 17 in verse number 9 when he says, The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Who can know it? The answer is given in v. 10 of Jeremiah 17. I, the Lord, search the heart. I try the rains, even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doing.

We hear it all the time. We hear people say, oh, you just need to broaden your horizon. You just need to be more open-minded and you need to be more inclusive and so on and so forth. You need to be open-minded. And when they use that phraseology, oftentimes what they'll do is they'll say, you are just narrow-minded. That's the opposite of being open-minded is being narrow-minded. And we've been accused of being narrow-minded. And often I've said I can only be as wide as my Bible is. Amen? And we're going to be as narrow as the Word of God is. Why?

Why would I leave the truth for something that's less than truth? It doesn't really make sense, does it?

No, I need to have the mind of Christ. Amen? Here's what Paul says in the book of Philippians. He says, let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, in Philippians 2, in verse number five. And we find it in the book of 1 Corinthians. He talks about that we have the mind of Christ. To know God is to know His word. And we understand that God has given.

Howbeit, I sent unto you all My servants, the prophets, rising early, and sending them, saying, O, do not this abominable thing that I hate. Isn't God so gracious in longsuffering? They forsook the Lord. They forgot the Lord. They followed after idols. But God in His grace and His mercy and His longsuffering, He sent prophets, and He sent those prophets faithfully. Jeremiah, one of them. But notice what it says in verse number eight, But they hearkened not, or inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods. Wherefore, My fury and Mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they are wasted and desolate as at this day. What did God say back in Deuteronomy 11? He said that if you had a deceived heart and you followed after other gods, that He would withhold the rain. Remember, He said, if you obey Me, if you keep these commandments, I'm gonna send the rain, the former and the latter rain. I'm gonna bless and I'm gonna, God controls, listen, there's no mother nature. It's God that's controlling, amen. He is the creator and the sustainer of all things.

For then had we plenty of vittles, and were well, and saw no evil. God's grace and God's mercy and God's long-suffering was misinterpreted by the people of God as being God's approval, that God was okay with their behavior, because God didn't immediately judge them. They thought, man, when we were serving these idols and pouring these things out to the queen of heaven, we had plenty. We didn't have all these problems. We have the problems that you're dealing with now because God's judgment came. And instead of them turning to God, they said, you know what? We're just gonna keep on doing what we did before. Man, that's terrible. And God tells us in Deuteronomy 11, take heed, and here's what he says, take heed that your heart be not deceived. How many times have you heard somebody say, I mentioned about hearing people say all the time in the culture and the society in which we're living that we need to be open-minded and we've dealt with that, but I want you to consider this.

Because the heart is deceitful. And he gives the warning to his people in Deuteronomy 11, preserved for us, take heed that your heart be not deceived. You say, oh man, my heart's not going to be deceived. I can trust my heart. First Corinthians 11 says, let he that thinketh he stand, take heed lest he fall, amen?
