The one that transcends time, the one that's outside of time was able to do that because all scripture is given by inspiration of God. This morning, I hope that we have a newfound appreciation for the Bible. We'll talk about it as we go over the next few weeks of understanding how God's greatness is revealed through giving us the Bible, but then what is my response to it? We already gave a little indication of that with Joshua 1 and verse number 8. How I approach the Bible, what I do with the Bible, how I live by the precepts that are contained there and why? Because I understand it's from God. It's not just Paul speaking, it's not just Isaiah speaking, it's not just David speaking, it's God speaking because all scripture is given by inspiration of God. What a joy, what a blessing that every day you have the opportunity in your life to open up this book to hear from God, to hear from God, to be benefited because it's profitable, to be helped. This book is precious. This book is the greatest of all books because God, who alone is great, is its author. Let's pray together. Father, we love you. Thank you for loving us. We thank you this morning for the Bible. We thank you that in your infinite wisdom, you determined that you would give us the Bible.",
