Notice what it says, according to all that the Lord commanded Moses, so did they. No shortcuts. They did it all.

Chapter 40 of the book of Exodus, one of my favorite chapters of the Bible, because you see what takes place with the rearing up of the tabernacle.

They did the work. They did what God called them to do. And you come to verse number 34.",
