      "text": "read the entirety of the chapter, I do not, but I'm gonna just kind of pick my way through the chapter here. And I want you to see a great lesson from this portion of Scripture that's a negative example. but I hope will help us to see the importance of the fact that others are watching us. Someone is watching you and the impact of your influence. Beginning in verse number one of 2 Chronicles 33, the Bible says Manasseh was 12 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 50 and five years in Jerusalem. Now, I want you to understand that here, Manasseh is the king after Hezekiah. Now, Hezekiah was a good king. Hezekiah was the one that we understand that as the Assyrians come, he comes to the Lord and he lays it all out and he trusts the Lord and God blesses and God works and delivers them from the Assyrians, the people of Judah, but we understand that Hezekiah was told from Isaiah that he would die. Hezekiah prayed and he requested that he would not die and he was granted 15 more years. In those 15 years, we understand if you were to read that the Babylonians, there's an entourage of people that come from Babylon and Hezekiah shows all of the things within his realm. We find that Isaiah comes and says, he inquires about what has taken place and we find that the truth is given to Hezekiah",
