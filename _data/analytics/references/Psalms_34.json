Because you're declaring His greatness. I'm thanking God for what He's done, for who He is, and for how He's worked. And I'm having that thankful spirit, that thankful attitude, and in so doing, in giving thanks, we're magnifying our God. Because we're letting others know how great He is. We're letting others know what He's done and how He's worked. As the people of God, we understand that we have been given the command of offering thanksgiving to our God. He is worthy of our praise. In everything, give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. So many people desire to know the will of God, and they want to know some specific essence or aspect of the will of God. But for many of us this morning, there is much revealed to us in His Word about the universal, if you will, will of God for His people. It is God's will that we thank Him. It's God's will. Amen? Notice in Psalm 34, turn back, if you will, in Psalm 34, another psalm here that's attributed or ascribed to David. And notice in Psalm 34, again, this idea of magnifying the Lord, this resolve to magnify the Lord and how you and I should have this same level of resolve,",

At all times. Why has that got to be in there? Because we're to bless the Lord at all times. Because God is always good. Amen? There's sometimes that we think that God is good based on our circumstances. You hear something happen and God works and God delivers and God provides and someone says, man, isn't God good? God's good all the time. It's His nature. Amen? And we find here that He says, I will bless the Lord at all times. And then it says this, His praise shall continually be in my mouth. Continually. Not occasionally, but all the time. We're so filled with who God is. We've spent so much time in His presence that His praise shall continually be in my mouth. Notice what the psalmist says.

He gets sold into slavery, ends up in Egypt in a foreign land. And we find that he's there, that he's purchased by Potiphar and he's a servant. Really he's of great position within the house of Potiphar. He says so much so that there's none greater in the house than me. What a great position. But Potiphar's wife came after him. She lied about him and he ends up in prison. He didn't do anything wrong. In fact, he did everything right. Amen? Biblically speaking, he did everything right. I often, and I said it during the message of that chapter, he lost his coat, but he retained his character. Better to lose his coat and be falsely accused than to jeopardize his walk with God. He said, how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? The trouble came, he ends up in prison and we understand. And again, when we think about the life of Joseph, when we think about a life marked by troubles, listen, we have troubles in our lives. Sometimes our own doing, but many times outside of our control, just things that happen. The enemy attacking and the enemy trying to cause us to stop serving the Lord. I think about Psalm 34, it's a precious Psalm of David.",

The enemy attacking and the enemy trying to cause us to stop serving the Lord. I think about Psalm 34, it's a precious Psalm of David. David makes two powerful statements in this chapter with regard to troubles. The first one is this in Psalm 34 in verse number six. He says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. Now David had some troubles that were not of his own doing. David had some troubles that were the result of his own doing. All right, really you can look at David's life in two aspects and you can see some of the troubles that David had, they're his own doing. Some of the troubles that David had, he had nothing to do. He didn't ask to be anointed to be the king. He didn't ask to go and to be in the place where he was there with Saul, to be hunted by Saul and all of those things. And we find that he says, this poor man cried and the Lord heard him and saved him out of. all of his troubles, but I want you to skip over, you see that in verse 6 of Psalm 34, look at verse 19 if you will.",

I find the truth of verse number 6, I'm actually going to back it up and look at verse 17, but I think of the truth of verse number 6 where David is sharing his testimony, he's testifying of his own personal experience. This is my experience, I had troubles but God heard me when I cried and God delivered me. The Bible says this, the righteous cry, and the Lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles. Notice this verse 18, the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and save it such as be of a contrite spirit. Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all. And I'm so thankful that though we have trouble in life, we have a God who is greater. We have a God who has purpose. We have a God that in the midst of the trouble he can bring to pass great things. If we simply remain faithful, if we simply remain steadfast, if we simply remain obedient and keeping our eyes on the Lord, even in the midst of the trouble and the difficulty,",
