      "text": "I want you to think about your service to the Lord, and the reality is that, listen, I'd rather clean bathrooms for the Lord than do something else for the world, amen, and what a delight. Somebody came to me not long ago and said, pastor, what can I do? I'll clean toilets, I'll clean this, I'll do that, whatever, I just wanna serve the Lord, and praise the Lord for that kind of perspective because why, it's a privilege to serve God. It is an absolute privilege. The psalmist says here in Psalm 84, what he would rather do, be a doorkeeper in the house of my God. I want you to think about Psalm 100, and of course, we're familiar with that psalm. It's a very familiar psalm to us, but I want you to see what the psalmist says in Psalm 100 in verse number two. The Bible says this, serve the Lord how? With gladness, with gladness. Come before his presence with singing, and we think about this truth as we review our attitude towards serving the Lord. I get to do this, I get to serve God. I can do it with gladness, and why? Because my perspective is that it's for the audience of one, for the audience of one. I'm serving the Lord. I have the privilege of being able to serve Christ. You say, well, as the pastor, you get to, no, no, listen, we get to serve Christ.",

      "text": "and we'll get back to the Book of Colossians. We will finish it up this year, but thinking about Thanksgiving, this upcoming week on Thursday, and seeking the Lord with regard to direction for message. And I hope that between this morning and this evening, that you will leave church today with a whole list of reasons to rejoice, amen? And so get your fingers ready. We're gonna begin here in 1 Peter 2. It's just gonna be our launching spot, and we'll look at a number of passages of scripture throughout the morning and this evening as well. And I am so thankful for the Word of God, amen? And we have much to be thankful for. The Bible says, let the redeemed of the Lord say so, and we ought to have a song in our hearts. We ought to have praise on our lips. The Bible says, let everything that hath breath, praise the Lord, praise ye the Lord, amen? And man, I was encouraged by the children this morning, memorizing Psalm 100, and what a blessing to hide the Word of God in your heart, and the songs that they sang. God is good, amen? He is good all the time, and what a blessing to know the Lord. The songwriter said this, Jesus is the sweetest name I know. I agree with the songwriter, amen? When you hear the name Jesus, something just happens. I mean, you hear the name of Jesus,",
