      "text": "reaping. Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then defilest thou it, he went up to my couch. And so as we look at this firstborn son, Reuben, standing before his father, Jacob, we find that he mentions about his place in the birth order, that he's his firstborn. We notice and we could look in 1 Corinthians 5, you might wanna reference it, verses one and two, how that his birthright was forfeited and therefore the genealogy is not to be followed after the Reuben being the firstborn. And we can read of that in 1 Chronicles 5 as the genealogy is given. But we notice in verse number four that Jacob says unstable as water, thou shalt not excel. Those are not words that you wanna hear. Would you agree? I mean, these are not pleasant words. These are not words that one would be desiring to hear. But we find that as you continue to read in verse number four that what happens is there is sin exposed. We find that here in the text of Scripture, something that had happened many years prior, but evidently had never been dealt with is now being exposed. I would say that it seems as you read the Scriptures that there's never a time in recorded Scripture where Reuben has any level of brokenness or repentance. And we find that this sin that had happened many years ago is now being referenced and discussed",
