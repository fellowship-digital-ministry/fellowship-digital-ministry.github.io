As we began looking at the names of God, we've made the note of understanding that God would use a number of names in the Old Testament to call Himself, and as He would use those names, He would be communicating with His people various aspects of His character. And He would, of course, through the use of these names, He would highlight certain aspects of His character, of His attributes, and what a blessing it was for the people of God in the Old Testament as they would receive the truth as God would reveal Himself to them by these names and how it encouraged them and impacted them. And I said this last week, that as we today study the names of God, and we're looking at ten of them, we did five last week and we'll do five this evening, but as we look at these names of God that we have the opportunity just in like manner as those Old Testament saints to be encouraged as we are reminded of who our God is and how He has revealed Himself in Proverbs 18 and verse number 10, the Bible says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runneth into it and is safe. The psalmist said in Psalm 148 and verse number 13, let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is excellent, His glory is above the earth and heaven.",

The psalmist said in Psalm 148 and verse number 13, let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is excellent, His glory is above the earth and heaven. In our first study dealing with Thy name is great, we looked at the name of God, Elohim. It's the first name of God that's used in all of the Bible. In Genesis chapter number 1, we find in the beginning God and we find that Elohim, meaning the strong one, and dealing with the fact that He is the Creator and how that is so foundational to understand the whole of Scripture, that He is the Creator. We dealt with the proper name of God, Yahweh or Jehovah, and understanding that He is the self-existent One. In Him is life. People ask that question when you speak about God being the Creator, well, who created God? No one, He is. And He is the self-existent One, Jehovah Yahweh. Adonai, dealing with the fact that He is Lord or Master, He is our strength, and we said this last week, that as our Lord or as our Master, that He rightly deserves our worship and our obedience. El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty, and how we rejoice in God revealing Himself to Abram as being El Shaddai, the Lord God Almighty.",
