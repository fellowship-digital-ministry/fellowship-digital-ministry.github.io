And that's why he mentions back in verse number four, as we talked about the golden censer, that as he would on that day of atonement, as he would go in, he would take and he would make that offering, but he would go with that golden censer to be able to have that smoke fill so they did not see the glory or gaze upon the glory of God. Now it's interesting if you were to study Leviticus 16, and I recommend that you read the passage of scripture, it's very interesting all that had to happen on the day of atonement. This was the highest of all holy days for the nation of Israel. And we find that on that particular day, you understand that the high priest, that he was arrayed in beautiful garment, right? I mean, just the glory of the garments of the high priest. But on that particular day, you know that he took off those garments and he put on a linen garment to be able to go in. When you think about the Lord Jesus Christ as the passage will come in verse number 11, and you think about how Jesus set aside his glory that he had for all of eternity, and he came to this sin-cursed world.",
