      "text": "days in which we deal with adversity and great opposition and disappointment. But we find that our God is always faithful and he is always trustworthy and dependable. He always does what he says he will do. And as we look at the life of Abraham tonight, as we look at this portion, I trust that you'd be encouraged. Look at verse number nine with me. We'll get right into the message. The Bible says this in verse number nine, and his sons, Isaac and Ishmael, buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephraim, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre. I've just titled the message this evening from that phrase in verse number nine, Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham. As we look at the portion of scripture, if you're taking notes this evening, what you notice first of all, the descendants of Abraham. We begin reading this portion of scripture and we find that as you enter down into and get familiar with the timeline, you find that Abraham, when he dies, is 175 years old. And so therefore, we would find that this particular text of scripture that is given to us takes place 38 years after the death of Sarah. Now, of course, we read and studied the portion of scripture a few weeks ago in Genesis 23, where the Bible told us of the death and burial of Sarah and how that Abraham came to mourn for",

Now, of course, we read and studied the portion of scripture a few weeks ago in Genesis 23, where the Bible told us of the death and burial of Sarah and how that Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. And we find that at that time he was 137 years old, and now we find that he's 175 years old. And so these 38 years have now passed, and the Bible begins by telling us in verse number one of the text of scripture, then again, Abraham took a wife and her name was Ketorah. We find that as we read the next few verses of scripture that we'll read of the sons that were born to Abraham through Ketorah. But before we look at that, as we think about the descendants of Abraham, of course, we'd first have to go back to Genesis chapter number 16 and see the birth of Ishmael. We find that he, of course, was the one that was born really after the flesh, Hagar being the the mother of Ishmael. We understand the disappointment that was contained within the portion of scriptures we studied many months ago and had the opportunity to see how that through the counsel of Sarah and all that had taken place. And Ishmael is born, and we find",

      "text": "We'll be looking at the entire chapter this evening, Genesis chapter number 23. I'll read the first couple of verses and we'll get right into the message this evening. And Genesis 23 beginning in verse number 1, the Bible says this, and Sarah was 107 and 20 years old. These were the years of the life of Sarah. Sarah died in Kirjath Arba, the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. I've titled the message there from that phrase in verse number 2, Abraham came to mourn for Sarah. As we come to this passage of Scripture, we've mentioned in recent weeks as we've studied through the book of Genesis, of course, the mountain peak of Genesis chapter number 21 with the birth of Isaac and all that God had promised and the fulfillment of said promise and what joy and what excitement in the life of Sarah and Abraham. And of course, we've gone through a number of these events. And we mentioned last week as we studied chapter number 22, that it says, and it came to pass after these things, and the timeline is not exactly known, but we, understanding some of the terminology that is used, we believe that Isaac there is at least a teenager, maybe as old as 20 years old. And when you look at the passage and look at all that has taken place, we find that",

And when you look at the passage and look at all that has taken place, we find that God gives us, in chapter number 23, a marker, so to speak, a timing of us being able to understand some things that have transpired. We come to this chapter and we find that Abraham is here mourning for his beloved wife, Sarah. But God tells us in verse number one that Sarah died at the age of 127 years old. Now, 127 years old is the age of Sarah, according to verse number one. And by understanding other portions of Scripture, we understand that at this particular time that that would make Abraham 137 years old because he was 10 years her senior. And we also understand that at this time, Isaac would be 37 years old because he was, she was 90 when he was born, according to Genesis 21. And so Isaac here, at this particular time, at the count in Genesis 23, Isaac is 37 years old. Now, this revelation not only helps us to understand the age of Sarah and Abraham and Isaac, but we also have the opportunity, as we look back to Genesis chapter number 11, to understand that it's now been 62 years since Abraham and Sarah, at that time Abram",

Now, this revelation not only helps us to understand the age of Sarah and Abraham and Isaac, but we also have the opportunity, as we look back to Genesis chapter number 11, to understand that it's now been 62 years since Abraham and Sarah, at that time Abram and Sarai, left the Ur of the Chaldees in response to the call and leadership of God. Sixty-two years that they've been on this journey, that we've studied the life of Abraham in these passages of Scripture, these pages of the book of Genesis. And remember, as we mentioned in Genesis chapter number 11, how God just zeroes the focus in upon Abraham and upon the start of the Hebrew race. And we find here that as we come to this chapter, it's one of those chapters that provides us with a marker of time to be able to understand those things that have transpired. In addition to that, however, we find that as we come to Genesis 23, that there's a chapter in God's Word, a message tonight that I'll preach, that is given to the death and burial of Sarah. And we think about this passage of Scripture and think about the subject matter in which we'll deal with this evening, and we understand that generally speaking, mankind is aware of their mortality.

We understand that we have this survival mechanism within us. But as a child of God, we need not fear death. Amen? We approach death from a different perspective. And as we look at Genesis 23, go back if you will to our text of Scripture, I want to just look at this passage and I hope that it will be an encouragement to us. I hope that it will be a blessing to us as we consider the death of Sarah here in this passage of Scripture. Notice with me if you're taking notes this evening how Abraham responds. The Bible tells us, I've read v. 1 and 2 already, but of note is the latter part of v. 2 when the Bible says, and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. We find that here the Bible shows us and reveals to us the humanity of a man that we hold in high regard and high esteem. We see a man, a patriarch, Abraham, and we see him as being on the pages of Scripture and the great faith, and certainly he's a man of faith. We find him in the book of Hebrews in the 11th chapter repeatedly being referenced. And he's a man of faith, but he's a man.",

That loved one that we've now come to the place that yes, they're in a better place, they're with the Lord and how wonderful and how glorious that is, the reality is that my life has changed because of their presence no longer being here, right? We find that that is amplified, if you will, when you consider the love that you have for the deceased. It's his wife, he loved her. I want you to think also, not only as we note, as we go through Genesis 23, what is revealed, first of all, his love for Sarah, I believe that his perspective is revealed. His perspective, I want you to notice and perhaps you picked up on it as I read through the passage, but notice what he says in verse number four. I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. I'm a stranger and a sojourner. I think about this perspective and I think about the reality that we find in Hebrews chapter number 11. Again, hold your place here, but look at Hebrews 11, really even as it deals with the life of Sarah and Abraham within this section of the text of Hebrews 11, we find that there's interesting truth that is revealed.
