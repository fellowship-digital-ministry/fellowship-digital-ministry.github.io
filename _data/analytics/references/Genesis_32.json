      "text": "excited about the opportunity here on Sunday evenings for the next several months to be able to study through the life of Joseph. We first read of the character, the Bible character Joseph in Genesis chapter 30, verses 22 through 24. We won't take the time to turn back there, but it's there in those verses that God records for us the birth of Joseph. And we read that from that point until here in Genesis chapter number 37, obviously 17 years past, because the text tells us that he's 17 years old. There's only a couple of references to the life of Joseph from Genesis chapter 30 to Genesis chapter number 37. And both of those are found in Genesis 32 and 33, simply stating how that Jacob in preparing to meet Esau put them in the back of the camp and so on and so forth. And so his name is just mentioned very briefly. And so nothing about him is given to us as far as his life, his upbringing and so on and so forth. And so we come here to Genesis 37 and we read that he's 17 years old, but notice what the Bible tells us beginning in verse number one. And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. The lad was with the sons of Bilhah",
