And then it tells us, yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forget him. It tells us in chapter 41 that it was two full years after this interaction between the butler and baker and Joseph that the Pharaoh has a dream. But as we focus on chapter number 40 and we see the dreams interpreted and we see what takes place and we understand what's going on here, and ultimately as we look at this passage of scripture, having the entire book of Genesis and understanding what's going to happen next, we can see God's hand in this circumstance. We can see how God was orchestrating things in the life of Joseph, and we can see even as Joseph will testify later in his life when he speaks to his brothers how God sent him before them to preserve life and they meant it for evil, but God meant it for good and understanding all of that. And we read all the way through Genesis 50 and many of us are familiar with what happens in Joseph's life, but I would submit to you this evening that he's living moment by moment, day by day as we do. And as we look at this passage of scripture and understanding what's happening, Joseph does not know that while he is in this trial",
