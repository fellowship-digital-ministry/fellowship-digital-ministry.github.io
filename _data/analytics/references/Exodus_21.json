      "text": "it's a choice. And no, it's not a choice, it's a human being. And God is the giver of life. And we have to understand this morning that this is not a political issue, it is a biblical issue. Jeremiah 1 and verse number 5, the Bible says this, sorry, I think I'm on Exodus 21, sorry. Exodus 21, notice in verse number 22 it says, if men strive and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow. Now do you understand the language here? What's happening is there are men that are fighting, they hurt a woman that's expecting, her fruit depart, she has the baby. But it says here that there's no mischief to follow. In other words, the baby survives. The baby survives. The Bible goes on to say, he shall be surely punished according as the woman's husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But verse 23 says and if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life. What does it mean if any mischief follow? It means if the baby dies. That's what it means. And so if two people are fighting and there's a woman that's expecting that's there, and that woman gets hurt in the fight, and her baby is born. and there's no mischief, there's still a consequence, there's still a price to be paid, but if the baby dies, God says life for life.",
