      "text": "I worked in the corporate world, people would say, well, it's good enough for government work. You ever hear that? And you hear that phraseology, see the guy in the Air Force, he's like, oh yeah, I know all about that. But the reality is that we've heard that phraseology. Listen, the work that we're doing is for God Almighty. We never, but never should mail it in, so to speak, because we're doing a work for God. And we recognize that this is a great work. I won't take you there, but in Psalm 109 and verse 27, the Bible speaks about how people would see that it was God that did the work. We find that that's exactly what the enemy recognized in Nehemiah 6 and verse number 16. Now, I want you to think about this. The Bible tells us as to the day in which the work was completed. In verse number 15 of Nehemiah 6, it tells us that the wall was finished on the 25th day of the month, Elul. Now, that's the sixth month in the Jewish calendar. And I want you to go forward, if you will, to chapter number eight, and we're gonna just kind of pick it up right here in the beginning of chapter number eight. And I want you to see what the Bible says. And all the people gathered themselves together as one man in verse number one into the street that was before the water gate.",
