It says, my son, notice again, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. In chapter two, in verse number one, my son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee. We notice in chapter three, in verse number one, my son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments. We've read the passage in chapter number four. Notice in chapter five, my son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding. I like that. In my mind's eye, my sanctified imagination, when I read Proverbs 5, in verse number one, and I see the expression to bow thine eye, or excuse me, thine ear, to my understanding.

Keep my commandments and live in my law as the apple of thine eye.",
