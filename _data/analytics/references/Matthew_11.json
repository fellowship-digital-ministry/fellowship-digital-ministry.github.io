      "text": "25. Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one. Keep in mind the question of verse 24. When the Jews say to Jesus, if thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. That word plainly means without concealment. That word plainly means openly or frankly. And so we understand what they're asking. They say, if you're the Christ, tell us plainly. And notice that Jesus says, I told you, and ye believe not. Now keep that in mind, and turn to the book of Matthew, if you will, as we keep this thought from John 10 in our minds this evening. And I want you to look at the Gospel of Matthew, and let's seek to gain further insight here in Matthew 11. Matthew 11, and notice what the Bible says here in verse 25. In Matthew 11, in verse 25, notice the Bible says, at that time Jesus answered and said,",

In Matthew 11, in verse 25, notice the Bible says, at that time Jesus answered and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast, notice this word, revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight. All things are delivered unto Me of My Father, and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father. Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and He to Whomsoever the Son, you see the word again, will reveal Him. Now that word reveal means to make known. That word reveal means to uncover, to make bare, to disclose, or to make manifest. And so we find that here, Jesus says that He is revealing. Notice it says that He says that you've hid these things from the wise and prudent in verse number 25, but hast revealed them unto babes. Now look at Matthew chapter number 16. And notice here, the same word revealed is going to be used in our text of Scripture. And I want you to notice in Matthew 16, and beginning in verse number 13, I gave note of this passage just a moment ago,",

      "text": "number 19, but Thomas was not there. By the way, after what happened, I don't think Thomas ever missed another gathering. Amen? And chew on that for a little while. Thomas wasn't there, and he says, I will not believe at the end of verse number 25, because they told him that Jesus had came to them. And it says in verse 26, and after eight days again his disciples were within, notice it says expressly, and Thomas with them. Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, by the way, our God is so gracious. He is so merciful. Our God wants to reveal Himself. He's come to manifest Himself. We read the gospel accounts. Remember we used that word reveal there in Matthew 11, and Matthew 11, and Matthew 11, and Matthew 11, chapter number 16, He told them in John 10, He said, they said to Him, tell us plainly, He said, I've told you. Listen, Jesus is so gracious and so merciful and He, knowing what has transpired, as He comes to this place where they're gathered together, He focuses attention upon Thomas and notice, He says, reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing. Why did Jesus do that? Well,",

      "text": "Spirit of God, the Apostle John says this at the heels of this great revelation. It says, in many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book, but these are written. Why are these written? That you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you might have life through His name. The purpose of John, according to these verses, that you might believe, and he says that these things have been written for the purpose of revealing, for the purpose of manifesting the truth. The truth of what? The truth that Jesus is God. The evidence is overwhelming, and I believe the evidence clearly reveals to us that Jesus is God. They said in John 10, tell us plainly. He says, I have. I told you, and you believe not. Jesus said in Matthew 11 and Matthew 16, it's the Father that has revealed these things. It's not that God has masked the truth. God has very clearly revealed the truth, and it's not just in someone making a claim. Listen, there was some guy over in Israel like six months ago that was claiming the Messiah. He had all kinds of people following him. Listen, you can claim whatever you want to claim. Jesus did claim to be God, but He also revealed it through all of these things that we've looked at this evening, and",
