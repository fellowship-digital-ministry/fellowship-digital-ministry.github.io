      "text": "We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, right? It's all about Christ. See the reality is that no one's going to see an exalted Chris man and say, I need that. But if they see an exalted Christ in my life, I want His God, amen? Because let me tell you what God has done in my life. Let me tell you how God has changed my life. Let me tell you... And we begin to just magnify God. We just begin to declare His greatness. We just keep lifting Him up and lifting Him up and exalting Him. And all of a sudden, it's not about us, it's all about Him. John said, He must increase, I must decrease. They said, John, He's baptizing and all men do follow Him. Glory to God. That's the point, amen? That people would follow Jesus. I want you to think about those that dealt with pride. They failed to exalt the Lord, to magnify Him in their lives. I'll use just a couple of examples. Think about Saul. Turn to 1 Samuel chapter 15. And I'm actually going to be preaching from 1 Samuel 15 this evening, but I just want to take one verse and be mindful of what is said by Samuel to Saul. In the midst of his disobedience here in 1 Samuel 15 and verse number 17, notice what Samuel says to him.",

In the midst of his disobedience here in 1 Samuel 15 and verse number 17, notice what Samuel says to him. If you're there, 1 Samuel 15 and verse number 17, Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, dost thou not make the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed the king over Israel? You know what happened to Saul? He wasn't little in his own sight anymore. He thought he knew better than God. Samuel was very clear, I'll mention this this evening, he was very clear in verses 1 and 2 that this was the commandment of the Lord. This was God's instruction to Saul. But Saul disobeyed it. And Samuel says, when you were little in your own sight, oh, that God would help us to remain little in our own sight, that we're nothing. You say, that's not good for my self-esteem, I know. But it's true, we're nothing. It's all because of God's amazing grace. It's all because of Jesus. Jesus, Uzziah, 2 Chronicles 26. You're familiar with these examples, but I want you to see what the Word of God says. It's amazing how God helped King Uzziah. The Bible tells us in verse number 5 that he sought God in the days of Zechariah.",

      "text": "in college. And he said, I'm going to the Marines. And I was like, good luck with that, man. So much for I don't have to do what anyone tells me to do, right? The reality is that obedience is a good trait of God's people. We're obedient, we're obedient. Turn to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 15, if you will. It's a portion of scripture that's familiar to many of us. In 1 Samuel 15, we read of Saul and his partial obedience. And you've often heard me say that partial obedience is really nothing more than disobedience. The command that was given from the Lord through Samuel to Saul was very plain and very clear. And yet we find that Saul did not obey the command that had been given to him. Samuel comes on the scene and Samuel is aware of the disobedience, not only because of the word of the Lord, but because of what he could hear and observe himself. He knew of the disobedience of Saul. And I just wanna draw your attention, we're not gonna read the entirety of the text or even much of it, just a verse of scripture. Notice in verse 22, the Bible says, and Samuel said, hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices. Why is it that Samuel says that? Well, because Saul tries to excuse his disobedience by saying we're gonna make an offering, we're gonna make a sacrifice.",
