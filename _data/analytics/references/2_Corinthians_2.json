      "text": "2 Corinthians 2, we'll be looking at verses 12 down through verse 17 this morning and finishing up this second chapter as we're studying through the book of 2 Corinthians. And last week we looked at the preceding text of Scripture in verses 5-11 and in that passage we dealt with the subject matter that Paul was giving this counsel to the believers in Corinth and we titled the message forgiveness and the importance of understanding that this one that had offended had responded to the church discipline. They had, as we could look through the Scriptures and as best we can tell, they had repented and God gave through the Apostle Paul instruction to this church with dealing with this individual and to comfort him and to, well to forgive him and to comfort him and then to confirm your love toward him. It was the threefold process that God gave and Paul then said this at the end of verse 9 that he wanted to know whether they'd be obedient in all things. See the matter was serious and Paul was concerned about the unity of the church in Corinth and Paul understood that the church was a church, if you read the first letter, that was known for its divisions and contentions and all that was going on. It was a carnal church that the enemy was having his way and we find that the Apostle",

      "text": "kill Him in the garden before He could ever get to the cross. But He went to that cross, and He was buried in that borrowed tomb, and He rose, conquering sin, death, and the grave, and our enemy was defeated once for all. And according to Colossians chapter two, God, the Lord Jesus Christ, spoiled principalities and powers, and He made a show of them openly. triumphing over them in it. I think Paul had the same thought in mind here as he did in 2 Corinthians 2. I'm reminded of 1 John 3 in verse number eight. I'll read the verse for you and we'll get back to our passage in 2 Corinthians. But the Bible says this in 1 John 3 in verse number eight. He that committed the sins of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. We see the source of victory. We see the scene of victory. But as we go back to 2 Corinthians chapter number two, I believe that we see the strategy for victory. The strategy for victory. Now, before you get too ahead of yourself, I'm not being contradictory. The source is Jesus. But understand that if we want to experience the victory, we must do it his way. God's work must be done God's way. It's a truth throughout the scriptures. So vitally important.",

      "text": "of us for we are not ignorant of his devices. Obviously, as we begin our study of 2 Corinthians, we understand there's much history between the Apostle Paul and the church at Corinth. It was God that used the Apostle Paul to go to Corinth to see a church established and God used Paul in a great way. Paul writes to the church in Corinth and we have the letter of 1 Corinthians and we find that in that letter, the Apostle Paul deals with many things that are taking place within the church. We find that he begins to deal with the divisions and the carnality and all that's present in the church at Corinth. He then begins to address problems in the church in Corinth and we'll reference one said problem that's in 1 Corinthians 5 this morning in this text of scripture in 2 Corinthians 2. And then Paul goes on as you continue to read through the book of 1 Corinthians and he kind of makes this transition and you can read it this way in chapter number seven in verse number one. He says, now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me. And so the Apostle Paul gives them truth. Of course, it's all under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit of God, but he's dealing with what's going on at Corinth. He's addressing the matters, but then evidently the church in Corinth, some part of the church at Corinth",
