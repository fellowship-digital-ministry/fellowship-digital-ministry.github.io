      "text": "are acting like they didn't know that we should expect these things even though God's told us these things. Too many Christians are failing to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ. As we live, we act, we talk as if our Savior's been defeated. How sad that is. Victory is ours. Victory is sure. We're not defeated. We have an enemy but He is a defeated foe. Greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world. Is that not what the Bible says in 1 John 4? We find that He tells us that we are more than conquerors in Christ. We find it in 1 Corinthians in chapter 15. He tells us, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory. How? Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Listen this morning, we need to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ and see Him in His rightful place and understand that He has overcome the world. Listen Satan tried to do everything he could. He understood the spiritual war and the spiritual battle. He did everything that he could to prevent the Lord Jesus Christ from going to the cross of Calvary in the first place and then after He goes to the cross He does everything that He can to prevent the resurrection but there's nothing He can do. He's defeated because God is greater and we have to see Him in that rightful place. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised.",
