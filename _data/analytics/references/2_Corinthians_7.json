He doesn't actually reference him finding Titus until 2 Corinthians 7 verses 5 and 6 and so if you want to call it a parenthetical, it is a big parenthetical that Paul is about to elaborate on the ministry and I'm so thankful that God called the Apostle Paul and that God used the Apostle Paul and that we have the opportunity to be able to look at the perspective and philosophy that God gives to us through these pages of scripture with regard to the ministry. Notice that Paul says this in verse 14, now, now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place. As we look at this portion of scripture this morning, I want to preach a message that I've simply titled Victory in Jesus and we're all familiar with that song, that song that we sing, a familiar hymn, Victory in Jesus and I'm so thankful this morning that Paul experienced victory and that we understand that we too are victors, we have victory because our Savior",
