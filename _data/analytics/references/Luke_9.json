      "text": "But notice what they request, and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word. Wow, that is commendable, that is exemplary. See, they prayed that God would give them boldness in the face of adversity. They did not pray that God would eliminate the adversity. They prayed that though the adversity is there, God would give us boldness. I want you to recall with me that James and John, not too long before this particular account, desired to call fire from heaven like Elijah did. Turn back, hold your place here in action, turn back to the book of Luke, if you will. In chapter number 9, I want to read this passage of Scripture to you here in Luke 9, because this did not take place that long before the text of Scripture in which we're reading this morning. In Acts chapter number 4, they say, Lord, behold their threatenings, but God, our request is that you'd give us boldness to speak thy word. In Luke chapter number 9, in verse 51, the Bible says, and it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him, and they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.",
