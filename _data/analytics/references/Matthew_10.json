      "text": "He didn't, He wasn't walking fearfully, He was walking wisely. Can I tell you this evening, that we as the people of God, we need to walk in wisdom, we need to walk wisely. Notice if you will, in Matthew chapter 10, as we consider some instruction for us as the people of God, if we're seeking to take this truth from 1 John 2 and verse 6 to say that we ought to walk as Christ walked, we look at how He walked, and then we say, okay, what instruction do we have in God's Word for us as individual followers of Jesus Christ that we're to walk in like manner? Notice in Matthew chapter 10, and it's a verse of Scripture that we've often referred to, notice what Jesus says in Matthew 10, and in verse number 16, the Bible says this, behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Be therefore, what's it say, wise as serpents and harmless as doves. You know, we understand the use of the analogies, and you find here that He says, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. How's that gonna fare for the sheep? Well, there's gonna be problems, there's danger, there's difficulty, but He says therefore we're to walk wisely, we're to walk in wisdom. I'm thankful that the shepherd gives us the protection that we need, but He says that",
